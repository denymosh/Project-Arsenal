Understanding AI Growth Opportunities
We expect S&P 500 earnings to grow at a double-digit rate this year and we 
also like companies that increase their dividends at a 10%-plus rate. How 
does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. We 
derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our 
coverage of major publicly traded players and most of the mid-tier players, 
along with our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate that annual 
revenue from the global AI infrastructure industry -- data center spending, 
chips, network equipment, storage etc. -- amounted to $600 billion in 2025. 
We expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is 
forecast to reach $3.0 trillion. Forecasters are making such claims because the 
market for AI technology is changing rapidly and broadening dramatically. In 
fact, in the months leading up to Nvidia's latest quarterly results release, the 
company announced multiple new AI partnership deals -- not with the 
hyperscalers 
that 
dominated 
earlier 
GPU 
demand, 
but 
with 
multiple 
neoclouds, large global enterprises, and sovereign clients. Indeed, as AI 
winnings are redeployed into other areas (healthcare, aerospace & defense, 
financial services), the industries can benefit from operational efficiencies, 
new 
products, 
new 
markets, 
and 
disruptive 
developments. 
From 
an 
investment standpoint, a market rotation of assets out of purely AI and into 
potentially beneficiary segments can be healthy for near-term stability in the 
stock market. The AI trade may be bumpy going forward. But like other 
transformational technology trades before it (cloud, internet, semiconductors, 
and PCs), it seems likely to be long and fruitful.
DAILY SPOTLIGHT
STOCKPICKER'S CORNER
NVIDIA Corp (NGS: NVDA) 
BUY
Nvidia is the clear market-share leader in all AI accelerators, including those 
in the cutting-edge Blackwell family. It has significant competitive advantage 
in that its first-mover status enabled it to become the provider to all the major 
AI and cloud service providers. The company's multi-generation lead in GPU 
compute technology and its CUDA library, NIMs, and other software and 
hardware products provide a comprehensive solution unmatched by any 
competitor.  Even as the growing AI pie attracts large and small competitors, 
we expect Nvidia to remain the linchpin of the generative AI industry. 
Beyond data center, Nvidia also has huge growth opportunities in gaming, 
professional visualization, and automotive.
