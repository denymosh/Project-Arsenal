Overview
MetaPlatforms
is
the world’s
largest social
media platform. The
company’s
portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to
multiple
apps
like
photo
and
video sharing app Instagram, and
WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house
developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products
used by more than 3.58 billion people on a daily basis.
Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth
$200.966
billion
in 2025. Advertisement accounted
for 97.6%
of
revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms
including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications
and websites.
Meta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in
the
advertising
space
wherein
it
faces
tough
competition
from
Alphabet’s Google, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap. 
Meta
also
faces
significant
competition
from
the likes of
Apple
(messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media)
and Tencent (messaging and social media).
Meta
core
app enables people to
connect, share, discover and
communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers.
User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that
displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements
customized for each user. 
Instagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can
express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.
Messenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and
secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way. 
Meta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.

Reasons To Buy:
Meta Platforms’ focus
on integrating AI into its platforms — Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram,
Messenger and Threads — is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues. AI is heavily dependent
on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.54 billion daily users. Meta AI usage
continues to increase, which is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. The
company’s
initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant
responses is expected to boost engagement.
Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow for Meta Platforms, supported by AI. Instagram
Reels had a strong fourth-quarter, with watch time up more than 30% year-over-year in the United
States. Improving the quality of recommendations is driving up engagement. Simplified ranking
architecture has enabled more efficient model scaling that has unlocked the ability for Meta Platforms’
systems to consider longer interaction histories to better identify a person’s interests. On Instagram,
the amount of original content in the United States increased 10% in the fourth quarter of 2025, with
75% of recommendations coming from original posts. META’s
new AI-powered recommendation
model for ads is driving ad conversions on Instagram. Expanding social commerce is driving usage of
Instagram as it remains popular among the younger demographic. Shopping tags and shop tab helps
users discover products and purchase them over the Instagram platform, thereby driving monetization.
WhatsApp is an extremely prized possession of Meta Platforms. Rapid adoption of WhatsApp Business by small and mid-sized businesses is
noteworthy. META has introduced AI tools that help businesses on WhatsApp assist their customers and help them discover new products.
Integrated AI helps businesses on WhatsApp create ads on Facebook and Instagram more easily. Meta Platforms is adding channel
subscriptions, promoted channels and ads in Status in the WhatsApp updates tab, which is now used by more than 1.5 billion people globally.
Moreover, Meta Verified on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp is a popular initiative under which the company offers four subscription plans
to help businesses build credibility. All plans include the verified badge, account support and impersonation protection. This boosts consumer
trust and attracts new businesses to the platforms.
Meta Platforms’ focus
on developing strong footprint in metaverse will drive prospect over the long term. Oculus is the result of the
company’s ambitious mixed reality efforts which was built on a stack of AI technologies. Meta Platforms launched Oculus 2 in September
2020 and second-generation consumer virtual and mixed reality device in 2024. The company’s AR glasses are leveraging an AI-centric
operating system. The multi-year partnership with Rayban-parent EssilorLuxottica is noteworthy regarding the development of AR glasses,
including the latest Oakley Meta glasses.
Meta Platforms has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, which makes it an attractive stock for investors. As of Dec.
31, 2025, cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities were $81.59 billion. We believe that Meta Platforms’ ability to generate strong
cash flows (free cash flow of $14.08 billion in fourth-quarter 2025) will help it to make further investments in product development and
acquisitions in the future. META continues to spend heavily on expanding AI infrastructure courtesy of the strong balance sheet. For 2026,
capital expenditure is expected to be between $115 billion and $135 billion.
Meta Platforms
benefits from
infusion of AI into its
platforms —
Facebook,
WhatsApp,
Instagram,
Messenger and
Threads — that
drives user
engagement and ad
revenues.

Reasons To Sell:
Challenging macroeconomic conditions, including tariff uncertainties, do not bode well for Meta
Platforms’
advertising business. Higher tariffs are expected to hurt digital ad spending. We also
believe sluggish monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern for
investors. Meta Platforms plans to focus on scaling and deepening engagements for Meta AI over the
next few years. Metaverse is yet to become a consistent revenue source The Reality Labs segment is
expected to continue reporting losses in 2026 at a rate similar to 2025. 
Meta Platforms currently faces stiff competition from other big and small social media players in terms
of user acquisition. In the ad space, we believe that Alphabet continues to have a significant
competitive edge, owing to its scale and diversified product offerings. YouTube, Snap and Pinterest
offer tough competition as far as user growth is concerned. Amazon as well as Microsoft’s
ad
business is growing rapidly. Intensifying competition for ad dollars is a major concern for Meta
Platforms.
Meta Platforms’ focus
on Reels, which generates lower revenues than Stories and News Feed, has been a headwind. The company
continues to ramp up investments on products (Video, AR/VR and AI) as well as security; costs are already on the rise. Operating expenses
are expected in the $162-$169 billion range for 2026, driven by higher infrastructure costs, which include third-party cloud spend, higher
depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses. Higher employee compensation driven by hires in AI space is expected to drive
expenses. Although META expects 2026 operating income to be above 2025’s
reported figure accelerating expenses will keep margins
under pressure in the near term.
As Meta Platforms hosts a huge amount of personal data, it has been under constant scrutiny from privacy groups and federal agencies. This
huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers. As a result, the company has been criticized for allegedly selling personal data to
advertisers in order to boost its top line. Meta Platforms also finds itself increasingly at loggerheads with authorities across different countries
who accuse the social media giant of repeatedly failing to co-operate with them on extremely sensitive matters. META is facing regulations
under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Digital Markets Act (DMA), Digital Services Act (DSA), Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI
Act), and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act (DMCC), making the stock risky for investors.
Stiff competition for
ad dollars, a plethora
of controversies over
the company’s
treatment of user
data and increasing
regulations related to
user privacy are key
concerns.

Zacks Stock Rating System
We offer two rating systems that take into account investors' holding horizons: Zacks Rank and Zacks Recommendation. Each provides valuable
insights into the future profitability of the stock and can be used separately or in combination with each other depending on your investment style.
Zacks Recommendation
The Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. The foundation for the quantitatively determined Zacks
Recommendation is trends in the company's estimate revisions and earnings outlook. The Zacks Recommendation is broken down into 3 Levels;
Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. Unlike many Wall Street firms, we have an excellent balance between the number of Outperform and
Neutral recommendations. Our team of 70 analysts are fully versed in the benefits of earnings estimate revisions and how that is harnessed
through the Zacks quantitative rating system. But we have given our analysts the ability to override the Zacks Recommendation for the 1200
stocks that they follow. The reason for the analyst over-rides is that there are often factors such as valuation, industry conditions and
management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model.
Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the
quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reflects trends in earnings estimate revisions.
Zacks Style Scores
The Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way
to focus on the highest rated stocks that best fit their own stock picking preferences.
Academic research has proven that stocks with the best Value, Growth and Momentum characteristics
outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns
a rating of A, B, C, D and F. We also produce the VGM Score (V for Value, G for Growth and M for
Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. This is
perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of
Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B.
