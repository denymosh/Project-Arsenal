Nvidia: Full Steam Ahead With an Impressive Array of 
Announcements at CES 2026
Analyst Note Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 6 Jan 2026 
Nvidia touted its lineup of product innovations at a keynote address at CES 2026 in Las Vegas and 
hosted a question-and-answer session with financial analysts. The firm ’ s artificial intelligence roadmap 
remains on track, with its Vera Rubin products coming to market in the second half of 2026.
Why it matters: We remain highly pleased with Nvidia ’ s AI roadmap. The company continues to 
innovate in rack-scale AI solutions, expand its library of open-source AI models to support ecosystem 
development, and advance physical AI solutions, such as autonomous vehicles.
g Vera Rubin is expected to deliver five times the performance of current-generation Blackwell 
products for certain AI inference tasks. Nvidia is adding a host of storage, optical, and networking 
enhancements to Vera Rubin racks.
g Nvidia will also bring a full-stack autonomous driving solution to market in the first quarter of 2026 
inside the Mercedes-Benz CLA. AI is becoming increasingly important in autonomous vehicles, and 
we think Nvidia is uniquely positioned to support existing car makers in physical AI.
The bottom line: We maintain our $240 fair value estimate and Very High Uncertainty Rating for wide- 
moat Nvidia. Nvidia ’ s shares appear undervalued, and recent AI bubble concerns seem overdone. We 
still believe AI demand is quite healthy for Nvidia in the near term.
One long-term investor concern has been whether the long tail of companies will see benefits from AI

over time. We think Nvidia ’ s expanding library of domain-specific, open-source models is intended to 
help these developers, making it less likely that any of them will fail in AI.
g Nvidia only briefly discussed its recent licensing agreement with Groq, where it is bringing key assets 
and employees into the company. We think this is effectively an acquisition of low-latency chipsets 
that might supplement Nvidia ’ s future roadmap as AI workloads disaggregate.
Business Strategy & Outlook Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 20 Nov 2025 
Nvidia has a wide economic moat, thanks to its market leadership in graphics processing units, or 
GPUs, hardware, software, and networking tools needed to enable the exponentially growing market 
around artificial intelligence. In the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second-sources or 
in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but these efforts will, at best, only chip away at 
Nvidia ’ s AI dominance.
Nvidia ’ s GPUs run parallel processing workloads, using many cores to efficiently process data at the 
same time. In contrast, central processing units, or CPUs, such as Intel's processors for PCs and servers, 
or Apple ’ s processors for its Macs and iPhones, process the data of "0's and 1's" in a serial fashion. The 
wheelhouse of GPUs has been the gaming market, and Nvidia ’ s GPU graphics cards have long been 
considered best of breed.
More recently, parallel processing has emerged as a near-requirement to accelerate AI workloads. 
Nvidia took an early lead in AI GPU hardware, but more importantly, developed a proprietary software 
platform, Cuda, and these tools allow AI developers to build their models with Nvidia. We believe Nvidia 
not only has a hardware lead but also benefits from high customer switching costs around Cuda, 
making it unlikely for another chip designer to emerge as a leader in AI training. Nvidia's expansion into 
networking has been impressive, allowing customers to cluster AI GPUs together for AI training.
We think Nvidia ’ s prospects will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time. We 
expect leading cloud vendors to continue to invest in in-house, while AMD is also working on GPUs and 
AI accelerators for the data center. However, we view Nvidia ’ s GPUs and Cuda as the industry leaders, 
and the firm ’ s massive valuation will hinge on the pace of AI buildouts in the years ahead.
Bulls Say Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 20 Nov 2025
u The AI infrastructure opportunity is massive, and Nvidia foresees $3 trillion-$4 trillion of annual AI 
infrastructure spending by 2030.
u Nvidia ’ s data center GPUs and Cuda software platform have established the company as the dominant 
vendor for AI model training and inference.
u Nvidia is expanding nicely within AI, not just supplying industry-leading GPUs but also moving into 
networking, software, and services to tie these GPUs into even more-powerful clusters.

u Nvidia ’ s customers are a handful of the largest Tech companies in the world, and they all have an 
incentive to eventually diversify away from Nvidia to some extent.
u AI infrastructure spending has been impressive but revenue and use cases are less certain, perhaps 
providing doubts that there is a good return on investment on AI that might lead to a spending 
downturn at some point in the future.
u Geopolitics have entered the AI space, most notably limiting Nvidia's AI opportunities in China.
Economic Moat Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 28 Oct 2025 
We assign Nvidia a wide economic moat rating, thanks to intangible assets around its graphics 
processing units and high customer switching costs around its proprietary software, Cuda, for AI tools, 
which enables developers to use Nvidia ’ s GPUs to build AI models.

Nvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, which were originally developed to offload graphic 
processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. Nvidia has emerged as the clear market share leader in 
discrete GPUs. We attribute Nvidia’s leadership to intangible assets associated with GPU design, as well 
as the associated software, frameworks, and tools required by developers to work with these GPUs. 
GPUs perform parallel processing, in contrast to the serial processing performed by central processing 
units used to run the software and applications on PCs, smartphones, and many other types of devices. 
CPU examples include Intel’s and AMD’s PC and server processors, as well as Apple’s and Qualcomm’s 
smartphone processors. These CPUs conduct serial processing of 0's and 1's in a particular order to run 
an instruction set to run software and perform functions. In contrast, parallel processing does not need 
to run in a linear order. This is particularly useful, for example, when capturing an image. A GPU often 
has more cores than a CPU and performs simpler processing (such as capturing the data within a 
single image pixel) but throws many more cores at the image to catch all the data quickly. If CPUs were 
to conduct this task, they would have to capture the pixels in order; one can envision the CPU starting at 
the top and working its way down the image, while the GPU takes a snapshot in full.
In our view, the nature of parallel processing in GPUs is at the heart of Nvidia’s dominance in its various 
end markets. PC graphics were the initial key application, allowing for more robust and immersive 
gaming over the past couple of decades. In the past decade, however, the parallel processing of GPUs 
was also found to run the matrix multiplication algorithms needed to power AI models more efficiently. 
AI development has two key phases. The first is AI training. Using an image recognition example, 
developers might feed 50,000 images into a model, labeling them as either a picture of a cat, or not a 
cat. The model will look for the various aspects of each image and determine the scores and weights 
that are most common within a “cat” image. This may be an image with whiskers (although mice have 
whiskers too) or one with pointy ears (although the ears of a fox are also pointy), but a combination of 
all these factors may lead the model to effectively recognize cats in future images.
The second AI phase is inference, where the AI model decides on an image based on its prior training. 
In the cat example, the user would feed an unlabeled image into the model, and the model provides an 
output of whether it recognizes a cat or not.
Similar techniques are used in large language models associated with generative AI. In these cases, 
LLMs are fed with massive amounts of data, which may come from the internet, research papers, 
databases, and so on. Based on this data, the LLM determines scores and weights associated with 
language and which words are associated with one another. 
GPUs are best suited to make these many billions of calculations needed for LLMs to predict the next 
word in a query (GPT-4 was trained on 1.8 trillion parameters, for example). More important, Nvidia

made shrewd moves to build and expand the Cuda software platform, creating and hosting a variety of 
libraries, compilers, frameworks, and development tools that allowed AI professionals to build their 
models. Cuda is proprietary to Nvidia and only runs on Nvidia GPUs, and we believe this hardware plus 
software integration has created high customer switching costs in AI that contribute to Nvidia’s wide 
moat. 
Even if a chip competitor were to build a GPU on par with Nvidia, we surmise that the code and models 
built on Cuda to date would not be ported over to another GPU, giving Nvidia an incumbency advantage. 
It is conceivable that alternatives may emerge that might never touch Cuda or an Nvidia GPU, but 
Nvidia had virtually no competition in this arena at the dawn of AI, so any enterprise building an LLM 
but waiting for alternatives would have been left in the dust.
In AI inference, we believe that a variety of chip solutions will be used over time to detect patterns and 
provide the output associated with AI models. However, Nvidia’s entrenchment in AI training makes it a 
likely winner in AI inference as well, not only as training GPUs are repurposed for inference, but as 
Nvidia uses its training know-how to push the needle on more innovative inference products. 
Beyond Nvidia’s AI prowess today, which we believe is exceptionally strong, we think the company is 
making the proper moves to widen its moat even further. Nvidia’s software efforts with Cuda remain 
impressive, while Nvidia expanded into networking solutions, most notably with its acquisition of 
Mellanox for InfiniBand and, more recently, with its Spectrum Ethernet products. We don’t want to 
discount Nvidia’s know-how here either. Many AI models don’t run on solo GPUs, but rather a connected 
system of many GPUs running in tandem. Nvidia’s proprietary products, such as NVLink, do a good job 
of connecting Nvidia GPUs together to run these larger models. 
Looking at the competitive landscape, AMD is a well-capitalized chipmaker with GPU expertise, 
although we view the company as being in a position of weakness on the software front. Perhaps the 
biggest threat might be from in-house chip solutions from hyperscalers, such as Google’s tensor 
processing units, or TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia chips. There’s no guarantee that any of 
these chips will be superior to Nvidia’s GPUs across a wide range of applications, but it’s likely that each 
of these in-house chips might perform specific workloads better than a general AI GPU from Nvidia or 
others. 
However, we believe that cloud computing companies will have to offer their enterprise customers a full 
menu of GPUs and accelerators so that they can run AI workloads. Amazon and Google may use 
Trainium and TPUs to train their own AI models, respectively, but we think they may struggle to 
encourage a host of enterprise customers to optimize their AI models for these in-house semis. Doing so 
would prevent these enterprise customers from switching among cloud providers, and enterprises are 
typically loath to be locked into a single vendor. Thus, neutral merchant GPU vendors will likely be

demanded by enterprise customers, and again, we foresee Nvidia remaining at the head of the pack for 
quite some time.
Fair Value and Profit Drivers Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 20 Nov 2025
Our fair value estimate is $240 per share. This fair value estimate implies an equity value of $5.5 trillion. 
Our fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026 or effectively calendar 2025) price/
adjusted earnings multiple of 51 times and fiscal 2027/2028 forward price/adjusted earnings multiples 
of 31 times and 25 times, respectively.
Our fair value estimate and Nvidia’s stock price will be driven by its prospects in the data center and AI 
GPUs, for better or worse. Nvidia’s DC business has achieved exponential growth already, rising from $3 
billion in fiscal 2020 to $115 billion in fiscal 2025 and will likely be $191 billion in fiscal 2026, 
representing 66% annual growth.
We model 62% growth to $310 billion of DC revenue in fiscal 2027. Nvidia has disclosed at its GTC 
conference in Washington D.C. that it has visibility into $500 billion of cumulative Blackwell and Rubin 
revenue in calendar 2026, which we think implies $300 billion-plus of revenue coming in calendar 2026 
(which is effectively fiscal 2027). This increase is thanks to the relatively higher prices associated with 
Blackwell Ultra and the rapid growth in supply of such products. We no longer model revenue from 
China, but this has likely enabled even more supply for Blackwell sold to the rest of the world. 
We then model 23%, 15%, and 14% growth in fiscal 2028, 2029, and 2030, respectively, to $500 billion in 
fiscal 2030 (which is effectively calendar 2029), resulting in a 34% CAGR from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2030. 
The main driver of this tremendous growth is an ongoing increase in capital expenditures in data 
centers at leading enterprise and cloud computing customers. Nvidia has suggested that each 
gigawatt-sized data center represents a $50 billion opportunity for the company, while the firm has line 
of sight to tens of such GW data centers being built out this decade. 
We think it is reasonable that Nvidia may face an inventory correction or a pause in AI demand at some 
point in the medium term thereafter, so we model only 2% growth in fiscal 2031. Excluding this pause in 
expansion, we anticipate average annual DC growth in the low teens thereafter and consider this to be a 
reasonable long-term growth rate as AI matures. In the long run, we think that cloud computing 
revenue at the hyperscalers can grow at a low-teens rate, capital expenditures as a percentage of 
revenue remains at consistent levels at these hyperscalers, and thus we model Nvidia’s revenue growth 
to be on par with these cloud computing growth rates.
In gaming, which was formerly Nvidia’s largest business, we model 10% average annual long-term 
revenue growth, bringing the total business to over $28 billion in fiscal 2030. We have high hopes for

autonomous driving. We model $2.6 billion of revenue in fiscal 2026 and revenue growing at a 17% 
CAGR over the next decade to $9.2 billion of revenue in fiscal 2035.
In summation, Nvidia achieved 126% and 114% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, and has 
guided to 64% growth in fiscal 2026. While these percentages will represent peak growth rates, we still 
anticipate robust growth for Nvidia in the years ahead. We model a three-year CAGR of 47% for Nvidia 
from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028.
Nvidia’s massive DC growth has been gross margin-accretive, as GAAP gross margin expanded from 
57% in fiscal 2023 to 75% in fiscal 2025. We model a near-term dip in GAAP gross margin to 71% in 
fiscal 2026 as Blackwell is a more costly product to ramp up and Nvidia will recover only a portion of the 
loss associated with its H20 writeoff earlier in fiscal 2026. However, Nvidia should achieve mid-70% 
gross margins exiting fiscal 2026. 
In the long run, we anticipate a modest gross margin in the decade ahead, as we lower it to the low-70% 
range a decade from now. Still, we are optimistic about Nvidia’s ability to retain its pricing power in DC 
products, thanks to the high switching costs associated with the Cuda platform.
Nvidia earned an exceptional 62% GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2025, as it prospered from 
significant operating leverage during the AI boom. We anticipate that GAAP operating margin will be 
60% in fiscal 2026, again due to the H20 writeoff, but will hover around 60% (plus or minus 5%) in each 
year of our 10-year forecast period.
Risk and Uncertainty Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 28 Oct 2025
We assign Nvidia a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High due to the nascent nature of the AI 
market. In our view, Nvidia’s valuation will be tied to its ability to grow within AI, for better or worse. 
Nvidia is an industry leader in GPUs used in AI model training, while carving out a good portion of 
demand for chips used in AI inference workloads (which involve running a model to make a prediction 
or output). 
The biggest risk, in our view, is the pace of AI spending going forward. Nvidia prospered from 
exponential AI growth in recent years, but such spending comes from a handful of customers, and they 
all have an incentive to eventually optimize, if not reduce, their investments over time. Within these AI 
buildouts, we also think that tech leaders will turn to in-house chips for at least a portion of their 
workloads. Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia chips were designed with AI workloads 
in mind. Diversification is also possible, and among existing semis vendors, AMD is quickly expanding 
its GPU lineup to serve these cloud leaders. 
We also foresee geopolitical risk and uncertainty, most notably with US restrictions that have prevented 
Nvidia, at various times, from selling its AI products into China.

Capital Allocation Brian Colello, CPA, Senior Equity Analyst, 20 Nov 2025
We assign Nvidia an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating, which reflects our assessment of a sound 
balance sheet, exceptional investments associated with the firm’s strategy and execution, and attractive 
and appropriate shareholder distribution policies.
Nvidia is in outstanding financial health. As of October 2025, the company held $60.6 billion in cash and 
investments, as compared with $8.5 billion in short- and long-term debt. We think the firm generates 
sufficient cash flow and has ample resources to meet its debt obligations, capital expenditure 
requirements, potential acquisitions, and shareholder returns.
We remain impressed with Nvidia’s prescient investments in GPUs, networking semis, and software, as 
the company spent the past decade (if not longer) laying the groundwork to emerge as the clear leader 
in AI training GPUs and associated software and tools. We now believe that Nvidia benefits from hefty 
switching costs in the data center. Even if AMD or another competitor could build a semiconductor that 
is comparable with Nvidia’s data center GPUs, we surmise that AI developers will stick with Nvidia 
because such AI models were built with Cuda.
We think Nvidia’s investments in startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic are wise uses of cash. We 
recognize these deals are circular in nature. In theory, Nvidia might potentially push unwanted GPUs on 
to companies in which it has a stake. However, we view this risk as minimal in the near-term and even 
the long-run. These startups must buy as many Nvidia GPUs as possible to pave the way for leading 
large language models. Nvidia’s use of this cash inflow to make investments is reasonable, in our view. 
Given AI supply constraints, we have little near-term concern about Nvidia pushing unwanted GPUs on 
to its startup or neocloud partners.
On the M&A front, the deal that stands out is Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 
billion in early 2020. Mellanox sells networking products that focus on efficient data transfer in data 
centers via its InfiniBand technology. Nvidia has deployed InfiniBand masterfully while expanding its 
networking product lineup into Ethernet-based devices.
In September 2020, Nvidia attempted to acquire ARM Holdings from the SoftBank Group in a 
transaction valued at $40 billion. Nvidia’s hope was to steer ARM toward the development of data 
center products while incorporating Nvidia’s AI expertise. The deal immediately faced pushback from 
ARM’s licensee customers and regulatory challenges and was terminated in February 2022. We don’t 
think the failed merger was a dealbreaker for Nvidia, as the company continues to license IP from ARM 
and has launched its “Grace” line of ARM-based CPUs for the data center.
Management initiated a quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to return excess cash to 
shareholders, but the payout is rather immaterial today. Most of Nvidia’s distributions to shareholders 
come in the form of share repurchases.

Nvidia: Approval to Sell H200 AI Accelerators Into China Appears Forthcoming; $240 Fair Value Kept
Brian Colello, CPA,Senior Equity Analyst,9 Dec 2025
In a Dec. 8 Truth Social post, US President Donald Trump said the US will allow Nvidia to sell its roughly 
two-year-old artificial intelligence graphics processors, or GPUs, the H200, into China. The US 
government will reportedly receive a 25% cut on all sales, versus prior discussions of a 15% cut.Why it 
matters: The approval is a good first step for Nvidia to get back into the business of selling AI GPUs into 
China. The US has gone back and forth on restrictions, and may do so again in the future, but now we 
foresee at least a path to meaningful future AI revenue from China. Recently, the Chinese government 
has nudged its AI developers to shy away from Nvidia parts, so there’s no guarantee that the H200 will 
be widely adopted by the Chinese ecosystem versus domestic parts, even though the H200 is superior 
to the previously approved H20. That said, the Truth Social post said Chinese “President Xi responded 
positively!” The bottom line: We keep our $240 fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia. Shares rose 2% 
after hours on the news and still look undervalued. We think the recent selloff in AI names has 
presented investors with a buying opportunity. We retain our Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating 
for Nvidia. Geopolitics like US-China relations are just one of many moving pieces for Nvidia’s future 
revenue and earnings growth. Another risk has been the strong performance of Google’s Gemini AI 
model, based on its in-house TPUs. We’ve long expected custom ASICs like TPUs to carve out a piece of 
the AI market, but we’re not yet convinced that TPUs will widely encroach on Nvidia’s market 
dominance. Coming up: Our model doesn't yet reflect H200 revenue as we await details as to Chinese 
demand and the timing of license approvals and tax payments. A significant inflow of H200 revenue 
would likely boost our fair value, although Nvidia’s supply chain would need to expand even faster to 
serve not only the revival of H200s but also Blackwell products. 
Nvidia: Maintain $240 Fair Value Estimate Amid Reports of Meta’s Negotiations to Buy Google TPUs
Brian Colello, CPA,Senior Equity Analyst,25 Nov 2025
The Information reported that Meta Platforms is in discussions to buy Google’s custom Tensor 
Processing Unit, or TPU, chips for artificial intelligence. Shares of AI chip suppliers Nvidia and AMD 
were down as much as 4% and 7%, respectively, on Nov. 25. Why it matters: Google’s TPUs appear to be 
gaining traction outside of Google’s internal use cases. We’ve long expected hyperscalers like Meta to 
develop custom AI processors (ASICs), but it’s possible that Meta could diminish its chip development 
and turn to Google for ASICs instead. Meta is a large customer of Nvidia and an important emerging 
partner with AMD, the latter of which also aspires to gain AI processor share. These reports raise the 
risk, but not the certainty, that TPUs displace AI chips from these other two suppliers. However, we’ve 
long believed in an AI world where Nvidia, AMD, and ASICs all have a place. These discussions don’t 
change this dynamic, in our view. That said, the relative market share of chips from all three sources is

uncertain and will be based on future innovation and execution. The bottom line: We maintain our fair 
value estimates of $240 for wide-moat Nvidia and $270 for narrow-moat AMD. We retain our Very High 
Uncertainty Ratings for both firms because AI dynamics are changing rapidly and based on opaque 
negotiations among tech leaders. For Nvidia, we expect it to inevitably lose market share to ASICs like 
TPUs in certain use cases. However, the firm’s dominance in AI software and networking around these 
chips should keep Nvidia as the AI vendor of choice and the industry leader. The reports are perhaps 
more worrisome for AMD, which needs to prove its AI capabilities to hyperscalers. That said, we view 
these reports are more likely a shift in Meta’s ASIC strategy to TPUs, rather than a signal that the Meta-
AMD partnership is doomed. 
Nvidia Earnings: No Signs of a Near-Term AI Bubble; Raising Fair Value to $240 From $225 Brian 
Colello, CPA,Senior Equity Analyst,20 Nov 2025
Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter revenue of $57 billion, up 22% sequentially, up 62% year over year, 
and ahead of guidance of $54 billion. Nvidia’s forecast for the January quarter of $65 billion would be 
ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate of $62 billion and be up 65% year over year.Why it matters: 
Nvidia again delivered excellent revenue growth as artificial intelligence demand still exceeds supply. 
Results contrast with AI bubble fears, although we view the risks as longer-term in nature. Nvidia’s 
supply chain is expanding even faster than in prior quarters, allowing for revenue acceleration. Data 
center revenue was $51.2 billion, up 66% year over year and up by $10 billion or 25% sequentially. 
Nvidia’s supply commitments are up 63% year over year, and the firm is preparing for even stronger 
growth with its latest Blackwell Ultra products. Nvidia has reiterated its expectations of $500 billion of 
Blackwell and Rubin product revenue by the end of calendar 2026, which we think implies $300 billion-
plus of data center revenue in calendar 2026. Nvidia still foresees $3 trillion-$4 trillion of annual AI 
infrastructure spending by 2030. The bottom line: We raise our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia 
to $240 from $225 as we lift our revenue estimates in the near term and beyond. We keep our Very High 
Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, given the fast-moving deals being made in AI. Shares rose about 6% 
after hours. We still see Nvidia shares as undervalued and view recent AI bubble chatter as a buying 
opportunity. Longer-term concerns about AI funding and energy buildouts are valid in the medium to 
long term, but 2026 is shaping up to be another stellar AI year, in our view. Coming up: Nvidia not only 
expects strong revenue growth in the January quarter, but also healthy gross margins in the 75% range. 
The firm is seeing higher input costs, but we anticipate that Nvidia’s strong pricing power will enable 
the firm to pass these costs on to customers. 
Nvidia: We’re Impressed With Visibility Into 2026 Revenue; Raising Fair Value to $225 From $190

announcements. Nvidia disclosed that, to date, it has visibility into $0.5 trillion of cumulative revenue

for its Blackwell and Rubin products in calendar 2025 and 2026. Why it matters: We’re pleasantly 
surprised by Nvidia’s disclosure of its backlog for Blackwell and Rubin products ramping in late 2026. 
We think this disclosure implies about $300 billion of data center revenue to be earned in calendar 2026 
(that is, fiscal 2027), above FactSet estimates. This compares with $100 billion in revenue earned from 
Hopper products from 2023 to 2025 and our estimate of $150 billion-$180 billion in revenue earned on 
Blackwell products to date. The bottom line: We raise our fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia to 
$225 from $190, as we lift our near-term estimates following this disclosure. AI demand doesn’t appear 
to be slowing at all, but the disclosure implies that the AI supply chain is expanding at an even faster 
pace than we envisioned. Shares rose 5% after hours to the $205 range, and we now view shares as 
undervalued. On the product front, Nvidia’s 6G collaboration with Nokia is perhaps the biggest news, 
but might not move the needle for Nvidia’s earnings, relative to its AI data center opportunity. 
Elsewhere, robotics remains an attractive long-term opportunity for Nvidia. Coming up: Nvidia 
continues to tout that it foresees $3 trillion-$4 trillion of AI infrastructure spending per year by 2030, 
representing a 40% annual increase from levels seen in 2025. Nvidia won’t capture all this 
infrastructure opportunity, but a 40% CAGR over the next five years would be quite impressive. Nvidia’s 
disclosure suggests that a 40%-plus growth year is in the cards for fiscal 2027. Nvidia’s leading cloud 
customers may discuss their capital-expenditure plans with earnings later this week, but Nvidia has 
confirmed that spending has not only not peaked but is likely accelerating. 
Nvidia: Shares Big AI Dreams With OpenAI as Firms Announce a Strategic Partnership Brian Colello, 
CPA,Senior Equity Analyst,22 Sep 2025
Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 
gigawatts (GW) of Nvidia systems for OpenAI’s artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia intends to 
invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI “as new Nvidia systems are deployed.” Why it matters: We think this 
partnership fits within the framework of the $500 billion Stargate project, announced in January. 
OpenAI and its Stargate partners have tremendous aspirations for AI, and Nvidia is cementing its role in 
these buildouts. The deal also likely squashes any concern that OpenAI’s new custom chip (developed 
with Broadcom) will materially dent Nvidia’s AI market share within these data centers. The bottom line: 
We maintain our $190 fair value estimate and our Very High Uncertainty Rating for wide-moat Nvidia. 
Shares rose about 4% on the news Sept. 22 and appear fairly valued. Our valuation is based on 
tremendous AI adoption, and the letter of intent is one of several we like to see to support these bullish 
industrywide growth expectations. The timing of buildouts was not disclosed. We’re cautiously 
optimistic that any expansion will be conducted at a measured and reasonable pace. Nvidia’s gear have 
short shelf lives, perhaps naturally squashing any temptation for massive buildouts years in advance of 
anticipated demand. Coming up: We hope to hear more about Nvidia’s future investments in OpenAI. 
Nvidia certainly has excess cash to invest in OpenAI in this manner. For now, we’ll consider any 
investments to be arm’s length transactions. However, these investments might be circular and raise

related party concerns, as Nvidia may own shares in a customer that will likely use such funds to buy 
more Nvidia gear. Further, and in general, we foresee four risks that may mute the industry’s AI 
aspirations—supply chain expansion, financing availability, energy/power requirements, and 
geopolitical restrictions. All this may affect the pace of this deal's buildouts over time. 
Nvidia: Collaboration With Intel Might Bring Some Goodwill With US; Maintain $190 Fair Value Brian 
Colello, CPA,Senior Equity Analyst,18 Sep 2025
Nvidia and Intel announced a collaboration to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data 
center and PC products. Nvidia will also invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a price of $23.28 per 
share.Why it matters: For Nvidia, we view this as a good investment. The company tried to dismiss this 
angle, but it might be buying some goodwill with the US government (which owns 10% of Intel) and, in 
turn, will be allowed to sell more advanced artificial intelligence chips into China. Nvidia has long 
paired x86 CPUs from Intel, such as Sapphire Rapids, with its GPU servers. The collaboration extends 
this relationship with NVLink connectivity. We haven’t expected AMD to gain share here, since AMD 
offers competing AI products. Nvidia’s deal to supply RTX GPU chiplets into Intel’s x86 PC CPU products 
should boost Nvidia's non-data center businesses. However, we’re hesitant to declare this PC win as a 
material driver of Nvidia’s future growth.The bottom line: We maintain our $190 fair value estimate for 
wide-moat Nvidia and retain our Very High Uncertainty Rating. The shares rose about 4% in Sept. 18 
trading but still appear modestly undervalued to us, as we see tremendous upside for AI buildouts in 
the years ahead. For Nvidia, we view the $5 billion investment as immaterial and don’t believe it will 
alter the company's core business plans. Nvidia reinforced its commitment to Arm-based Grace CPUs, 
for example, and won’t shift fully toward Intel x86 CPUs.Between the lines: Importantly, Nvidia gave no 
indication that it will use Intel 14A or otherwise shift significant portions of manufacturing to Intel 
Foundry. We doubt the $5 billion is meaningful enough to essentially force Nvidia to use Intel, either for 
core products or even for the chips in collaboration. K

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projec-
tion of a company’s future cash flows, resulting from our 
analysts’ research. Analysts create custom industry and 
company assumptions to feed income statement, balance 
sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our glob-
ally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or 
DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical tools to augment this process. Moreover, we 
think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows 
presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies, 
high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g., 
mines), or companies expected to generate negative 
earnings over the next few years. That said, we don’t dis-
miss multiples altogether but rather use them as sup-
porting cross-checks for our DCF-based fair value estim-
ates. We also acknowledge that DCF models offer their 
own challenges (including a potential proliferation of es-
timated inputs and the possibility that the method may 
miss shortterm market-price movements), but we believe 
these negatives are mitigated by deep analysis and our 
longterm approach.
Morningstar’s equity research group (”we,” “our”) be-
lieves that a company’s intrinsic worth results from the 
future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premi-
um to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in 
Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the 
biggest risk adjusted discount to their fair values, where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic 
worth.
Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) 
our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our es-
timate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around 
that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. 
This process ultimately culminates in our singlepoint star 
rating.
1. Economic Moat
The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not 
only in our qualitative assessment of a firm’s long-term 
investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of 
our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural 
feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a 
long period of time. We define economic profits as re-
turns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our es-
timate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost 
of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more 
susceptible to competition. We have identified five 
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are 
more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns 
for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are 
those in which we have very high confidence that excess 
returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more 
likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer 
a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic 
value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will 
see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.
When considering a company's moat, we also assess 
whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, 
stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, 
financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this con-
text, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if 
its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit 
on a cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the prob-
ability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not char-
acterize the company as possessing an economic moat.
2. Estimated Fair Value
Combining our analysts’ financial forecasts with the 
firm’s economic moat helps us assess how long returns 
on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm’s cost of 
capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rat-
ing are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a 
longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat 
firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:
Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts 
make full financial statement forecasts, including items 
such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in 
workingcapital accounts, and capital spending. Based on 
these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, 
after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.
Stage II: Fade
The second stage of our model is the period it will take 
the company’s return on new invested capital—the return 
on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to de-
cline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II 
period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in 
lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance 
sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The 
length of the second stage depends on the strength of the 
company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last 
anywhere from one year (for companies with no econom-
ic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat compan-
ies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four 
assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period, a normalized investment rate, average return on 
new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years 
until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The invest-
ment rate and return on new invested capital decline un-
til a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms 
that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal 
ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attribut-
able to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the 
second stage.
Stage III: Perpetuity
Once a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate a continuing value, using a standard per-
petuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any 
growth or decline or investment in the business neither 
creates nor destroys value and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.
Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash 
flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present 
value of expected future cash flows. Because we are 
modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash 
available to provide a return to all capital providers—we 
discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a 
weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and pre-
ferred stock (and any other funding sources), using ex-
pected future proportionate long-term, market-value 
weights.
3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate
Morningstar’s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture 
the range of potential outcomes for a company’s intrinsic 
value. This rating is used to assign the margin of safety 
required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives 
our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating is 
aimed at identifying the confidence we should have in as-
signing a fair value estimate for a given stock. 
Our Uncertainty Rating is meant to take into account any-
thing that can increase the potential dispersion of future

outcomes for the intrinsic value of a company, and any-
thing that can affect our ability to accurately predict 
these outcomes. The rating begins with a suggested rat-
ing produced by a quantitative process based on the 
trailing 12-month standard deviation of daily stock re-
turns. An analyst overlay is then applied, with analysts 
using the suggested rating, historical rating data, and 
their own knowledge of the company to inform them as 
they make the final Uncertainty Rating decision. Ulti-
mately, the rating decision rests with the analyst. Ana-
lysts take into account many characteristics when mak-
ing their final decision, including cyclical factors, opera-
tional and financial factors such as leverage, company-
specific events, ESG risks, and anything else that might 
increase the potential dispersion of future outcomes and 
our ability to estimate those outcomes. 
Our recommended margin of safety—the discount to fair 
value demanded before we’d recommend buying or 
selling the stock—widens as our uncertainty of the estim-
ated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain we 
are about the potential dispersion of outcomes, the great-
er the discount we require relative to our estimate of the 
value of the firm before we would recommend the pur-
chase of the shares. In addition, the Uncertainty Rating 
provides guidance in portfolio construction based on risk 
tolerance. 
Our Uncertainty Ratings are: Low, Medium, High, Very 
High, and Extreme.

Our uncertainty rating is based on the interquartile 
range, or the middle 50% of potential outcomes, covering 
the 25th percentile–75th percentile. This means that 
when a stock hits 5 stars, we expect there is a 75% 
chance that the intrinsic value of that stock lies above the 
current market price. Similarly, when a stock hits 1 star, 
we expect there is a 75% chance that the intrinsic value 
of that stock lies below the current market price.
4. Market Price
The market prices used in this analysis and noted in the 
report come from exchange on which the stock is listed 
which we believe is a reliable source.

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we 
compare it with the stock’s current market price on a 
daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calcu-
lated at the market close on every day the market on 
which the stock is listed is open. Our analysts keep close 
tabs on the companies they follow, and, based on thor-
ough and ongoing analysis, raise or lower their fair value 
estimates as warranted.
Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars. 
That is, the percentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can 
fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can 
serve as a gauge of the broader market’s valuation. When 
there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole 
is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few 
companies garner our highest rating.
We expect that if our base-case assumptions are true the 
market price will converge on our fair value estimate over 
time generally within three years (although it is im-
possible to predict the exact time frame in which market 
prices may adjust).
Our star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and 
individuals must consider their own specific investment 
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income 
needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other 
factors.
The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined be-
low:
QQQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk ad-
justed return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. 
Scenario analysis developed by our analysts indicates 
that the current market price represents an excessively 
pessimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximiz-
ing upside potential.
QQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-ad-
justed return is likely.
QQQ Indicates our belief that investors are likely to re-
ceive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of

and shareholder distributions. Analysts consider com-
panies’ investment strategy and valuation, balance sheet 
management, and dividend and share buyback policies. 
Corporate governance factors are only considered if they 
are likely to materially impact shareholder value, though 
either the balance sheet, investment, or shareholder dis-
tributions. Analysts assign one of three ratings: "Exem-
plary", "Standard", or "Poor". Analysts judge Capital Alloc-
ation from an equity holder’s perspective. Ratings are de-
termined on a forward looking and absolute basis. The 
Standard rating is most common as most managers will 
exhibit neither exceptionally strong nor poor capital al-
location.
Capital Allocation (or Stewardship) analysis published 
prior to Dec. 9, 2020, was determined using a different 
process. Beyond investment strategy, financial leverage, 
and dividend and share buyback policies, analysts also 
considered execution, compensation, related party trans-
actions, and accounting practices in the rating.

Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating Assessment:The ESG 
Risk Rating Assessment is provided by Sustainalytics; a 
Morningstar company.
Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Ratings measure the degree to 
which company’s economic value at risk is driven by en-
vironment, social and governance (ESG) factors.
Sustainalytics analyzes over 1,300 data points to assess a 
company’s exposure to and management of ESG risks. In 
other words, ESG Risk Ratings measures a company’s un-
managed ESG Risks represented as a quantitative score. 
Unmanaged Risk is measured on an open-ended scale 
starting at zero (no risk) with lower scores representing 
less unmanaged risk and, for 95% of cases, the unman-
aged ESG Risk score is below 50.
Based on their quantitative scores, companies are 
grouped into one of five Risk Categories (negligible, low, 
medium, high, severe). These risk categories are absolute, 
meaning that a ‘high risk’ assessment reflects a compar-
able degree of unmanaged ESG risk across all subindus-
tries covered.
The ESG Risk Rating Assessment is a visual representa-
tion of Sustainalytics ESG Risk Categories on a 1 to 5 
scale. Companies with Negligible Risk = 5 Globes, Low 
Risk = 4, Medium Risk = 3 Globes, High Risk = 2 Globes, 
Severe Risk = 1 Globe. For more information, please visit 
sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings/
Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluat-
ing a company or security. Ratings involve unknown risks 
and uncertainties which may cause our expectations not 
to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected 
and should not be considered an offer or solicitation to 
buy or sell a security.
Risk Warning
Please note that investments in securities are subject to 
market and other risks and there is no assurance or guar-
antee that the intended investment objectives will be 
achieved. Past performance of a security may or may not 
be sustained in future and is no indication of future per-
formance. A security investment return and an investor’s 
principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an 
investor’s shares may be worth more or less than their 
original cost. A security’s current investment perform-
ance may be lower or higher than the investment per-
formance noted within the report. Morningstar’s Uncer-
tainty Rating serves as a useful data point with respect to 
sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in our de-
termining a fair value price.
