Summary
Tesla’s
EV business is facing a slowdown, with deliveries
declining
for
a
second
straight
year
in
2025
amid
a
challenging demand environment. In response, the company
is
pivoting
toward
artificial
intelligence,
autonomy,
autonomous vehicles, and robotics, backed by a sizable $20
billion capex plan this year. While this strengthens Tesla’s
long-term narrative, the elevated investment
is likely to
pressure near-term cash flows. Meanwhile, Tesla’s
Energy
Generation and Storage segment is gaining traction, and the
Supercharger network continues to expand. The company’s
robotaxi service is expected to roll out in seven new cities in
the first half of 2026, with early driverless tests already
underway.
However, meaningful contributions from these
initiatives may take time, warranting a neutral view on the
stock for now.

Overview
Over the years, electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has evolved into a
dynamic technology innovator. It has transformed the EV space like
Amazon
changed
the
retail
landscape
and
Netflix
revolutionized
entertainment.
Tesla,
which
managed
to
garner
a
gold-standard
reputation over the years, is now a far bigger entity than it was at the
time of its IPO in 2010. However, with growing competition, Tesla's
market share in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States
has eroded to around 50%, from roughly 80% in 2020.
The firm’s
three-pronged business model approach of direct sales,
servicing and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla,
touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than
just
a
car manufacturer. The firm also
makes different kinds of
technology like self-driving software, charging stations and battery
development, et al. The technology titan has also made inroads into the
solar and energy storage business. In fact, Tesla’s
CEO Elon Musk
wants the company to be viewed primarily through the lens of AI and
robotics rather than solely as an automotive company.
Tesla operates under three segments: Automotive, Energy Generation/
Storage and Services/Others. While Automotive operations accounted
for
73.3%
of
the
total
sales
in
2025,
revenues
from
Energy
Generation/Storage and Services/Others constituted 13.5% and 13.2%
of the total sales, respectively.
Currently, the Texas-based company’s most popular vehicle offerings
are the Model 3 and Model Y, along with the Cybertruck. Tesla plans to
end production of the Model S and Model X in the second quarter of 2026.
Tesla’s
first, second and third gigafactory are located in Nevada, New York and Shanghai, respectively. Its fourth and fifth gigafactories, are
located in Berlin and Austin, respectively, and commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Reasons To Buy:
Thriving Energy Generation & Storage Business: Tesla's revenue from Energy Generation
and Storage business is on a robust growth trajectory on the back of the strong reception of
its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment stands out as Tesla's most lucrative,
boasting the highest margins. Over the past three years, energy storage deployments have
surged at a CAGR of 168%. With plans to begin production of Megapack 3 and Megablock to
meet escalating demand, deployments are expected to continue their upward trajectory.
NACS to Bolster Charging Business: Tesla's charging division is poised to substantially
enhance its overall profitability. Currently, the company's expansive global supercharging
network boasts more than 77,000 connectors. Noteworthy automotive giants like Ford,
General Motors, Mercedes and others have already enlisted to utilize Tesla's North American
Charging Standard. As a result, the charging business has the potential to evolve into a
substantial revenue stream for the company.
Promise AVs, Robots and AI: Tesla is pushing beyond electric vehicles and leaning deeper
into artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and robotics as its next growth engines. Its Robotaxi program is already live in Austin and the
California Bay Area, with plans to expand aggressively to seven new cities in the first half of the year, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix,
Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas. The company believes it has strong cost and scaling advantages in robotaxis. At the same time,
Tesla is installing first-generation production lines for Optimus, preparing for volume output. Optimus and the two-seat Cybercab AV are
expected to reach volume production in 2026. Tesla is also upgrading FSD (Supervised) with its end-to-end AI model. It is developing custom
AI inference chips for autonomy, targeted for production in 2027 and 2028.
Strong Balance Sheet: High liquidity and low leverage provide Tesla with the financial flexibility to tap growth opportunities. Its long-term
debt-to-capitalization of around 7% compares favorably with the industry’s 40%. The company’s times interest earned ratio of 16.6 is way
higher than the industry’s 5.08. Tesla exited 2025 with cash/cash equivalents/investments of around $44 billion.
Strength in the Energy
Generation/Storage
business, balance sheet
strength, and focus on
autonomous driving,
robotics and artificial
intelligence are set to drive
Tesla.

Reasons To Sell:
Weak Vehicle Sales: Tesla’s delivery slowdown underscores the rising pressure on its core
EV business. Tesla’s deliveries in 2025 the second consecutive year of declining volumes. A
more concerning aspect is that the pace of the slowdown has accelerated. Deliveries slipped
just 1% year over year in 2024, but the decline widened to more than 8% in 2025. A softer EV
market, intensifying competition and an aging vehicle lineup have all weighed on demand.
Massive Capex to Weigh on Near-Term Cash Flow: Tesla plans to spend around $20 billion
in capital expenditures this year as it pivots deeper into artificial intelligence, autonomous
driving, and robotics. This marks a sharp jump from roughly $8.5 billion last year and exceeds the prior peak of $11.3 billion in 2024. The
company is committing large sums upfront, while meaningful revenue contributions from AI, robotaxis, and Optimus are likely still years away.
While this will create long-term opportunity, Tesla is likely to face increased financial pressure in the near term.
Rising Competition: Competition is increasing from traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford as well as emerging players like
Rivian and Lucid in a market that Tesla has dominated until now. Therefore, Tesla is the only one with a share to lose. All other players are
gaining market share at its expense. Its US EV market share is currently below 50%, down from 63% in 2022. The company’s dominant
market position is likely to drop further, thanks to stiff competition. There are also concerns with respect to the China market, which is full of
home-grown players like BYDDY, NIO, XPeng and Li, among others. As China is a big market for Tesla, stiff competition is likely to erode its
share in the country.
Falling Regulatory Credit Sales: Another concern is declining regulatory credit sales, which have long supported its profitability. These
credits dropped 28% year over year in 2025. The fall comes as U.S. policy changes scrap penalties tied to fuel economy standards, removing
automakers’
incentive to buy credits. With legacy rivals ramping up EV production and needing fewer offsets, Tesla risks losing this
lifeline—adding pressure just as deliveries and margins already face strain.
Falling vehicle sales,
massive capital
expenditure plans and
intensifying competition
are creating headwinds.

Zacks Stock Rating System
We offer two rating systems that take into account investors' holding horizons: Zacks Rank and Zacks Recommendation. Each provides valuable
insights into the future profitability of the stock and can be used separately or in combination with each other depending on your investment style.
Zacks Recommendation
The Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. The foundation for the quantitatively determined Zacks
Recommendation is trends in the company's estimate revisions and earnings outlook. The Zacks Recommendation is broken down into 3 Levels;
Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. Unlike many Wall Street firms, we have an excellent balance between the number of Outperform and
Neutral recommendations. Our team of 70 analysts are fully versed in the benefits of earnings estimate revisions and how that is harnessed
through the Zacks quantitative rating system. But we have given our analysts the ability to override the Zacks Recommendation for the 1200
stocks that they follow. The reason for the analyst over-rides is that there are often factors such as valuation, industry conditions and
management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model.
Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the
quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reflects trends in earnings estimate revisions.
Zacks Style Scores
The Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way
to focus on the highest rated stocks that best fit their own stock picking preferences.
Academic research has proven that stocks with the best Value, Growth and Momentum characteristics
outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns
a rating of A, B, C, D and F. We also produce the VGM Score (V for Value, G for Growth and M for
Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. This is
perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of
Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B.
