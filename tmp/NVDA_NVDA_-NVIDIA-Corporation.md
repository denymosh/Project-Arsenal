Overview
NVIDIA
Corporation
is the worldwide leader in visual
computing
technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.
Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
based
solutions
that
now
support
high

Center,
professional
visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with
almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a
key catalyst.
NVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging
from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the
top
supercomputer
in
the world, located at
Oak
Ridge
National
Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in

Reasons To Buy:
Datacenter presents a solid growth opportunity for the company. As more and more
businesses are shifting toward cloud, the need for datacenters is increasing. To cater to this
huge demand, datacenter operators like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are expanding their
operations across the world, which is driving demand for the GPUs. This bodes well for
NVIDIA’s uptrend as well. Further, the company intends to focus on new growth boosters for
its data center business, such as inference, data science and machine learning techniques to
consolidate its presence in this niche market. Considered most preferred by the datacenter
operators, NVIDIA’s
GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space.
Additionally, the datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models
using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer
internet companies is anticipated to continue aiding the segment’s top-line growth. Our estimates suggest that the company’s revenues from
the Data Center end market are likely to witness a CAGR of 42.1% through fiscal 2026-2028.
NVIDIA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are
integrating NVIDIA’s AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company’s DGX Cloud AI
infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. Meanwhile, the expansion of
CUDA software and AI frameworks strengthens NVIDIA’s
ecosystem, making it the preferred choice for enterprises developing AI
applications. With AI adoption expected to accelerate in 2025 and beyond, NVIDIA’s
software and AI cloud solutions present another
significant revenue driver.
The generative AI revolution continues to be a tailwind for NVIDIA. The company’s Hopper 200 and Blackwell GPUs are designed for training
and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. The growing adoption of reasoning AI
models is driving the demand for higher computational power. NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell Ultra GPUs deliver up to 25x the token throughput
for AI inference compared to Hopper 100, solidifying NVIDIA’s
dominance in AI-driven computing. Additionally, AI adoption is spreading
beyond cloud hyperscalers, with industries such as healthcare, automotive and robotics increasingly investing in AI-powered solutions. This
diversification ensures NVIDIA continues to grow beyond its traditional customer base.
NVIDIA has received approval to sell its H20 AI chips in China after signing a deal with the U.S. government. This marks a significant
development for the company’s growth prospects. Under the terms of the agreement, NVIDIA will pay 15% of total revenues from H20 sales
in China to the U.S. government. While this revenue-sharing condition may slightly impact margins, the deal opens a valuable door to one of
the largest AI markets globally. The AI boom in China, driven by large tech companies and government-backed projects, could create steady
demand for H20 chips. The latest arrangement with the U.S. government could strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in China and boost revenue
contribution from the country, which dropped 13% in fiscal 2025 from more than 21% in fiscal 2023. Access to the Chinese market will support
its overall revenue growth and maintain its position as a leader in AI chip technology.
NVIDIA’s
foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive. The company, currently, is on a firmer
footing in the autonomous vehicle market. It is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions,
HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Notably, NVIDIA’s focus on incorporating AI
into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues. The company sees a $300 billion revenue
opportunity in this space, and its automotive revenues have already crossed the $2 billion annual revenue run rate.
NVIDIA is a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet and can be considered a below-average leveraged company, considering its total
debt to total capital ratio of 0.09 being lower than the industry average of 0.15. Also, the company’s times interest earned ratio of 361 is
significantly higher than the industry average of 310, suggesting it has better financial health and a lower risk of defaulting on debt
obligations. As of Oct. 26, 2025, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $60.6 billion, which is significantly
higher than its total long-term debt of $7.47 billion. Since it has net cash available on its balance sheet, the existing cash can be used for
pursuing acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives and distributing to its shareholders.
NVIDIA boasts a sturdy cash flow-generating ability. The company’s accelerated revenue growth, along with improving operating efficiency,
is bringing in higher cash flows. In fiscal 2025, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $64.1 billion and $60.72 billion,
respectively. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, it generated operating and free cash flows of $66.53 billion and $61.68 billion,
respectively. The higher cash flow-generating ability lends NVIDIA flexibility to invest in long-term growth prospects and return money to its
shareholders. In fiscal 2025, the company returned $34.54 billion to its shareholders through $834 million in dividend payouts and $33.71
billion in share repurchases. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, the company returned $732 million to its shareholders through dividend
payouts and repurchased stocks worth $36.27 billion. On Aug. 26, 2025, NVIDIA’s
board of directors approved a new $60 billion share
repurchase authorization, bringing the total limit to $74.7 billion. As of Oct. 26, 2025, the company had $62.2 billion remaining under the
existing share repurchase authorization.
Growth opportunities in
ray-traced gaming, high-
performance computing, AI
and self-driving cars are
encouraging.

Reasons To Sell:
The United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company. This is
because the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China
being its biggest importer. The trade war between the two countries has escalated over the
past few years, and the U.S. government has imposed export restrictions on NVIDIA’s
several AI chips. These restrictions have been significantly hurting NVIDIA’s data center chip
sales in China. During the first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call, the company revealed that it
lost $2.5 billion in H20 chip sales in China during the quarter. During its fiscal second-quarter
earnings release, the company gave no update on revenue loss from H20 sales restrictions in
China. This may be because the company has an opportunity to clear its H20 inventories
following the recent revenue-sharing deal with the U.S. government for H20 chip export approval. Though the deal with the US government
will give some relief, the uncertainties related to the US-China trade war remain a major concern. It recorded mere $50 million of H20 sales in
China during the third quarter of fiscal 2026.
NVIDIA’s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have
impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid
ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This does not bode well for NVIDIA’s prospects in the near term.
Despite strong revenue growth, NVIDIA’s
non-GAAP gross margins declined in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, with the non-GAAP gross
margin contracting 140 basis points year over year to 73.6%. Higher production costs associated with transitioning to more complex AI
systems weighed on gross margin. Additionally, operating expenses increased 38% year over year and 11% sequentially due to higher
compensation and research & development investments. While necessary for long-term innovation, rising costs could eat into profitability if
revenue growth slows in the coming quarters. With new product launches, including the Blackwell GPU series, expected to roll out later in
2025, cost pressures are likely to persist, further weighing on margins.
NVIDIA’s
reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for GPU production presents significant supply chain risks,
particularly given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan. A disruption in TSMC’s
supply chain — whether due to
geopolitical instability, trade restrictions, or capacity constraints — could severely impact NVIDIA’s
ability to meet demand. Given the
growing tension between the United States and China, further export restrictions on advanced AI chips could also limit NVIDIA’s ability to sell
high-end GPUs in key markets like China, potentially impacting revenue growth. Additionally, U.S. regulatory scrutiny on AI chip exports to
China continues to be a major headwind. If additional restrictions are imposed on selling AI accelerators to Chinese companies, NVIDIA’s
growth prospects in one of its largest markets could be significantly hindered.
While NVIDIA is the dominant player in AI computing, competition is intensifying. AMD’s MI300 AI accelerators and Intel’s Gaudi AI chips
are gaining traction, offering cost-effective alternatives for enterprises looking to diversify away from NVIDIA’s
high-priced GPUs.
Additionally, cloud giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are developing their own AI chips, which could reduce their reliance on
NVIDIA’s
GPUs over the long term. If these proprietary AI chips prove effective, NVIDIA may lose market share in its most profitable
segment. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s
Hopper and Blackwell GPUs require substantial capital investment from customers and cost-sensitive
enterprises may opt for lower-cost solutions from competing vendors.
A substantial portion of the company’s sales is derived from outside the United States. Sales revenues to customers outside the United
States accounted for more than 53% of the total revenues for fiscal 2025. Hence, we believe that any unfavorable currency fluctuation and an
uncertain macroeconomic environment may moderate the company’s growth.
The ongoing trade war
between the United States
and China, forex
headwinds and stiff
competition from AMD are
major headwinds.

Zacks Stock Rating System
We offer two rating systems that take into account investors' holding horizons: Zacks Rank and Zacks Recommendation. Each provides valuable
insights into the future profitability of the stock and can be used separately or in combination with each other depending on your investment style.
Zacks Recommendation
The Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. The foundation for the quantitatively determined Zacks
Recommendation is trends in the company's estimate revisions and earnings outlook. The Zacks Recommendation is broken down into 3 Levels;
Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. Unlike many Wall Street firms, we have an excellent balance between the number of Outperform and
Neutral recommendations. Our team of 70 analysts are fully versed in the benefits of earnings estimate revisions and how that is harnessed
through the Zacks quantitative rating system. But we have given our analysts the ability to override the Zacks Recommendation for the 1200
stocks that they follow. The reason for the analyst over-rides is that there are often factors such as valuation, industry conditions and
management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model.
Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the
quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reflects trends in earnings estimate revisions.
Zacks Style Scores
The Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way
to focus on the highest rated stocks that best fit their own stock picking preferences.
Academic research has proven that stocks with the best Value, Growth and Momentum characteristics
outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns
a rating of A, B, C, D and F. We also produce the VGM Score (V for Value, G for Growth and M for
Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. This is
perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of
Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B.
