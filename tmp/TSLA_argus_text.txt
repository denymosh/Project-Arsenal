Analyst's Notes
Analysis by Bill Selesky, January 30, 2026
ARGUS RATING:  HOLD
• Fourth-quarter profit down 17%, too early for an upgrade
• Tesla recently reported 4Q25 adjusted net income of $1.761 billion or $0.50 per share, down
from $2.107 billion or $0.60 per share in 4Q24. EPS beat our estimate of $0.48 per share and
the StreetAccount consensus estimate of $0.45.
• The lower 4Q25 earnings mostly reflected weaker Automotive sales, lower vehicle deliveries,
higher tariff costs, and higher average cost per vehicle, offsetting higher gross margins and
revenue growth in Energy Generation and Storage.
• Tesla does not provide any financial guidance, but management highlighted on its 4Q25
earnings conference call (January 28) that they anticipate a heavy capital-spending program in
2026 (over $20 billion versus $9 billion in 2025) to scale autonomous technologies, robotaxi,
and Optimus production. They also expect a continued pivot to AI and energy growth.
• In the near-term, management is expecting modest overall revenue and vehicle delivery
growth.
INVESTMENT THESIS
    Our rating on Tesla Inc. (NGS: TSLA) is HOLD. The company is one of the
largest electric vehicles (EV) sellers in the world and holds a significant portion of the
EV market share in the United States, with about 50% of the market as of the end of
2025. However, EV demand has slowed over the past 12 months, largely the result of
the expiration of government incentives (a $7,500 Federal tax credit) and waning

INVESTMENT THESIS
consumer interest.
    We do not believe this is an advantageous time to accumulate
shares in Tesla. Core electric vehicle (EV) demand is slowing (just
ask General Motors or Ford), while competition is intensifying and
pricing pressures are generating inconsistent gross margin growth,
leading to steadily declining 'forward-looking' earnings revisions.
So despite a modestly better-than-expected fourth quarter for Tesla
(which we see as an anomaly), we believe it will be difficult for
Tesla to turn around their generally weak operating results any
time soon. We anticipate that 2026 will include some 'rough
quarters,' just as CEO Musk noted at the end of the second quarter
of 2025.
    At the same time, we also believe that the company's valuation
metrics still depend heavily on unproven, long-term bets (like
robotaxis and AI), which are consuming capital at a breakneck
pace, but without clear visibility on near-term returns. Before we
can become more supportive of the stock in the near term, we need
to see a stabilization (or acceleration) of EV deliveries with clear
(sustainable) margin recovery, showing that demand and pricing
power have bottomed.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
    Tesla reported 4Q25 adjusted net income of $1.761 billion or
$0.50 per share, down from $2.107 billion or $0.60 per share in 4
Q24. EPS beat our estimate of $0.48 per share and the
StreetAccount consensus estimate of $0.45.
    The lower 4Q25 earnings mostly reflected weaker Automotive
sales, lower vehicle deliveries, higher tariff costs, and higher
average cost per vehicle, offsetting higher gross margins and
revenue growth in Energy Generation and Storage.
    Total revenue decreased 3% to $24.901 billion, while
Automotive division revenue declined 11% to $17.693 billion.
Services and Other revenue increased 18% to $3.371 billion.
    Gross margin (GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2025 reached
20.1% versus 16.3% in 4Q24, an increase of 380 basis points that
is attributable to higher average selling prices (ASP's) and a
stronger product mix.
    In the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla delivered 418,227 total
vehicles (11,642 Model S and Model X and 406,585 Model 3 and
Model Y), down 16% from the fourth quarter of 2024. The
decrease in year-over-year deliveries, we believe, is largely due to
the expirations of U.S. Federal EV tax incentives and intensifying
global EV competition.
    Energy Generation and Storage revenue totaled $3.837 billion in
the fourth quarter, up 25% from $3.061 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2024, reflecting strength in demand for battery storage,
as well as an expanding gross-margin performance.
    For full year 2025, the company reported an adjusted net profit
of $5.858 billion or $1.67 per diluted share compared to an
adjusted net profit of $7.960 billion or $2.29 in full year 2024.

EARNINGS & GROWTH ANALYSIS
highlighted on its 4Q25 earnings conference call (January 28) they
anticipate heavy capital spending program in 2026 (over $20
billion versus $9 billion in 2025) to scale autonomous
technologies, robotaxi, and Optimus production. They also expect
a continued pivot to AI and energy growth. In the near-term,
management expects to see modest overall revenue and vehicle
delivery growth in 2026.
    We are lowering our 2026 EPS estimate to $2.03 from $2.26 to
reflect our expectation for slower vehicle sales, margin pressure,
and rising capital expenditures tied to the company's shift to AI,
autonomy, and robotics.
    We are initiating a 2027 EPS estimate of $2.95 per share, which
implies higher revenue and profit growth as key investments
(robotaxi services, autonomy, energy storage) begin to scale.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH & DIVIDEND
    Our financial strength rating on Tesla is Medium, the middle
ranking on our financial scale. The company receives average
scores on our financial strength criteria of fixed cost coverage, cash
flow, profitability and an above-average score on
debt/capitalization levels. The company does not pay a dividend
and is unlikely to initiate one in the near term.
    Tesla's credit ratings are designated as Baa3/stable at Moody's,
while Standard & Poor's rates the company's credit profile at
BBB/stable. Tesla believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its
product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans, and other
needs.
    Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 stood at
$8.376 billion, consisting of short-term borrowings of $1.640
billion and long-term borrowings of $6.736 billion. This compares
to total outstanding debt of $13.623 billion at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2024.
    The total debt/cap ratio was 9.2% at the end of 4Q25, down
from 15.6% a year earlier and below the average for peer auto
manufacturers. Tesla's five-year average debt/cap ratio is 14.1%.
    Cash and cash equivalents totaled $44.059 billion at the end of 4
Q25, up from $36.563 billion a year earlier. In addition, this
compares to $41.647 billion generated at the end of the third
quarter of 2025.
    Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.813 billion,
down from $4.814 billion in 4Q24 and compared to $6.238 billion
in 3Q25.
    Tesla does not have a share-repurchase program, and we do not
believe that Tesla will initiate a program in the foreseeable future.

Argus Analyst Report
About Argus
    Argus Research, founded by Economist Harold Dorsey in 1934,
has built a top-down, fundamental system that is used by Argus
analysts. This six-point system includes Industry Analysis, Growth
Analysis, Financial Strength Analysis, Management Assessment,
Risk Analysis and Valuation Analysis.
    Utilizing forecasts from Argus’ Economist, the Industry Analysis
identifies industries expected to perform well over the next one-to-
two years.
    The Growth Analysis generates proprietary estimates for
companies under coverage.
    In the Financial Strength Analysis, analysts study ratios to
understand profitability, liquidity and capital structure.
    During the Management Assessment, analysts meet with and
familiarize themselves with the processes of corporate management
teams.
    Quantitative trends and qualitative threats are assessed under
the Risk Analysis.
    And finally, Argus’ Valuation Analysis model integrates a
historical ratio matrix, discounted cash flow modeling, and peer
comparison.
THE ARGUS RESEARCH RATING SYSTEM
    Argus uses three ratings for stocks: BUY, HOLD, and SELL.
Stocks are rated relative to a benchmark, the S&P 500.
• A BUY-rated stock is expected to outperform the S&P 500 on
a risk-adjusted basis over a 12-month period. To make this
determination, Argus Analysts set target prices, use beta as the
measure of risk, and compare expected risk-adjusted stock
returns to the S&P 500 forecasts set by the Argus Market
Strategist.
• A HOLD-rated stock is expected to perform in line with the
S&P 500.
• A SELL-rated stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500.
