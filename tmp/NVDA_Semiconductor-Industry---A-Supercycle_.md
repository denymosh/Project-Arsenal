Semiconductor Industry - A Supercycle?
February 12, 2026
Semiconductor Industry - A Supercycle? 
A Supercycle or Closer to a Peak…. 
In our Tech sector roadmap, published in January, we positioned the Semiconductor 
(Semi’s) industry as neutral. Although we expect growth to remain strong in 2026, 
EVA Momentum is reaching closer to peaking, and the market has already factored 
in a large amount of value creation going forward. Figure 1 shows Semi’s billing 
(sales) YoY change and EVA Momentum (Profitability growth). The correlation has 
been tight between the two historically, but the Semi’s Billings YoY growth has 
tended to peak 2-3 months ahead of EVA Momentum. EVA Momentum-adjusted 
consensus (right side of the dashed line) suggests a peak at the end of this year, 
around 9%. If the previous pattern holds, Semi’s Billings would be peaking around 
October. From the bottom in September 2023, there have been 27 months of positive 
EVA Momentum. The only prior cycle to see consistent growth over 30 months was 
2012-15. So, certainly this cycle is heading towards “Supercycle” status, but investors 
need to be aware that this is still a cyclical industry.         
Figure 1: Semi’s Billings YoY Change and EVA Momentum 
The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) forecasts an increase in Billings of 25% 
in 2026. 2025 ended with a record level of sales at close to $800bn, which was also a 
25.6% YoY increase. Growth increased through 2025 with slightly easier YoY 
comparisons until July (Figure 2), which is another reason we think the 1H of 2026 
will see strong performance before a sell off into Q4.  
Figure 2: 2025 Data Table 
 
 
 
 
Key Point 
EVA Momentum for the industry expanded 
through 2025, building on positive 
momentum. Firms in aggregate expanded in 
their incremental value creation with 
industry revenues expanding to a record 
high. We expect that growth will remain 
strong in 2026 but caution that the market 
tends to peak when billings peak, which is 
around 3 months prior to EVA Momentum 
peaking out. EVA-adjusted consensus 
suggests the peak would be around October 
this year. In the first half of the year, we still 
expect strong performance but would 
suggest a focus on stock picking. See page 3 
for our stock picks.

Semiconductor Industry - A Supercycle?
February 12, 2026
Why Does EVA Momentum Matter? 
EVA Momentum indicates the rate of growth in economic profit, scaled to sales. This is the first derivative of EVA. A higher number 
indicates higher Performance. EVA Momentum indicates if an industry or company is generating incremental value and can also be 
thought of as business model momentum. The market has historically anticipated the peaking in EVA Momentum (Figure 3), with the 
largest market gains made while EVA Momentum is increasing and selling around 3 months ahead of EVA Momentum peaking.

Another Strong Year Being Forecast  
Growth continued to be very strong in the Semiconductor market in 2025 and similar growth of 25.6% is forecast in 2026. 
“Semiconductors are the foundation of nearly all modern technology, and emerging technologies like AI, IoT, 6G, autonomous driving, 
and others will continue to drive robust demand for chips,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.  
 
Figure 5: Global Semiconductor Revenue 
 
The global semiconductor industry posted the highest-
ever annual sales in 2025, close to $800bn (SIA release 
on the 6th Feb).  
The latest demand update from the Semiconductor 
Industry Association (SIA) showed December 2025 sales 
of global semiconductors up 2.7% MoM and 37.1% YoY 
(Figure 61). Monthly sales are compiled by the World 
Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization. The 
WSTS forecasts a further increase of 25% in 2026, with 
the market to reach around $1trn.

About ISS EVA 
We are an independent equity research provider offering investing insights through the use of our proprietary Economic Value Added (EVA) framework. 
EVA converts accounting profits into economic profits and charges businesses for the use of Invested Capital. EVA is superior to traditional measures of profit because 
it is comparable across companies, industries, and countries, links to a consistent, transparent valuation framework, and provides a unique, unbiased view of Quality, 
Value, and Growth. 
Our experienced team of analysts offers both fundamental and quantitative company analysis through written research, bespoke research, a stock selection model, 
an online analytical tool offering +29,000 companies as viewed through the EVA framework, custom screening, and portfolio analysis. 
Key EVA Concepts 
The value of a firm = Capital + PV of EVA 
If EVA is increasing then the intrinsic value of the firm is too, suggesting that market value should follow (and vice versa). 
EVA = NOPAT - Capital Charge 
EVA is profit after all costs, including the cost of giving shareholders a decent return. 
EVA Margin = EVA / Sales 
A true economic profit margin covering income and asset efficiency. Our EVA Income Statement examines EVA’s line item drivers and offers key insights into business 
profitability. 
EVA Momentum = Δ EVA / Sales 
An incremental EVA growth rate indicator and key valuation signal and screening measure. The more positive the Momentum, the greater the growth in 
EVA, and upward pressure on shareholder returns. Inflections in EVA Momentum are an early and more reliable indicator of stock price inflections. 
EVA Shock = Δ EVA Momentum 
Changes in EVA Momentum is a powerful signal within our framework, with significant relationship with stock price performance. 
Market Implied Momentum (MIM) 
The annual EVA improvement required for 10 years to justify the prevailing market enterprise value, expressed as a percent of sales; represents a market implied, 
long-range EVA margin improvement target. 
Future Growth Reliance (FGR) = (Market implied value of future EVA growth) / EV 
Measures the % of a company’s total enterprise value represented by expectations for future growth in EVA. FGR is key to understanding embedded 
expectations today and versus history. A low FGR versus history coupled with improving EVA trends indicates that the market is not pricing in the improving business 
model.
