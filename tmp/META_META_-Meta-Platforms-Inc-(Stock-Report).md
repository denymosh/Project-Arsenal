Meta Earnings: Strong End to 2025 as AI Monetization Begins 
to Show; Shares Remain Undervalued
Analyst Note Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026 
Meta reported strong fourth-quarter earnings, with sales growing 24% to $60 billion. Operating 
margins contracted 700 basis points to 41% as AI-related costs continue to mount. The firm's 2026 
guidance calls for $125 billion in capital expenditures and $162 billion in operating expenses.
Why it matters: Meta's ad business continues to perform at full capacity, with the firm's investments in 
artificial intelligence continuing to drive metrics such as engagement, ad efficacy, and content 
recommendation.
g Engagement metrics, including time spent on Instagram and Facebook, remain strong, with video 
engagement particularly strong. As users spend more time on its platform, Meta can show them more 
ads, driving ad impressions up 18% for the quarter.
g We were similarly impressed by Meta leveraging its AI investments to drive growth in ad clicks (up 
3.5% for Facebook) and conversions (1% increase for Instagram). While marginal, these 
improvements can unlock substantial topline dollars considering Meta's scale.
The bottom line: We maintain our $850 fair value estimate for wide-moat Meta, with the firm's 
outperformance on sales offset by its 2026 capital and operating expenses guidance coming in ahead 
of our estimates. Despite shares being up, we continue to view them as undervalued.
We think that as the year continues, investors will align with our bullish view on Meta as more

datapoints regarding the impact of the firm's AI investments on its core ads business come to the 
fore.
Coming up: Meta expects sales for the first quarter to grow a whopping 30%, driven primarily by a 
healthy demand for its ad products. We expect this strength to continue into the remainder of the year, 
and model 2026 sales growth at 25%.
g We expect the launch of Meta's latest large language model in the coming months, with the LLM 
likely to be competitive with frontier labs such as Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
Business Strategy & Outlook Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026 
We view Meta as the clear winner in social media. The firm ’ s application lineup, which includes 
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, has close to 4 billion monthly active users, giving 
Meta unmatched scale in the sector.
The firm's strategy is dual-pronged. On the user side, Meta has leveraged its scale and social media 
savvy to iteratively improve its product lineup, adding attractive features such as Stories, Reels, and 
even new products such as Threads. Such improvements/additions not only improve user engagement, 
but also allow Meta to monetize these features/products by layering advertisements onto them.
On the advertising side, Meta allows advertisers of all shapes and sizes to place ads in front of engaged 
users. The company has benefited greatly from a general shift toward digital advertising within the 
broader advertising market, with social media advertising gaining substantial share, especially since 
the covid-19 pandemic. To bolster its advertising business, Meta has invested heavily to improve its ad- 
targeting algorithms, allowing it to improve its advertisers ’ return on ad spending and increasing its 
average revenue per user over time.
While the firm ’ s core business remains advertising, Meta has shown a proclivity to expand beyond its 
ad-based revenue model by investing heavily in hardware, via Reality Labs, and AI, by investing in its 
own Llama large language model. While the firm ’ s investments in Reality Labs have been demonstrably 
unprofitable, we are more optimistic about Meta ’ s investments in AI. We believe Meta ’ s AI investments, 
especially those aimed at improving the firm ’ s ad-targeting algorithms, are value-accretive.
Beyond ad-targeting, Meta is also investing in consumer-facing AI, via its Llama chatbot, which is 
accessible to users across its applications. While a monetization strategy for this chatbot remains 
elusive in the near term, we believe the firm could drive increased user engagement/time spent by 
allowing its users access to a chatbot assistant within Meta ’ s applications.

and Shein. A slowdown in spending by these firms could hit Meta's growth.
Economic Moat Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 22 Jan 2025
We believe Meta merits a wide economic moat rating due to the firm's intangible assets and the potent 
network effect around its Family of Apps business. While the firm's Reality Labs segment continues to 
hemorrhage cash, we believe Meta's FoA business' strong competitive advantages will likely allow the 
firm to generate returns in excess of its cost of capital over the next two decades. 
Family of Apps
We assign a wide moat rating to Meta's Family of Apps, or FoA, business segment. We believe that the 
firm has built significant intangible assets, primarily via the customer data it collects and a potent 
network effect that has enabled Meta to be the most dominant social media platform in the world. 
Meta's FoA segment includes revenue from its social media applications including Facebook, 
Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The firm's dominance in social media is evidenced by its four 
primary applications constituting four of the six most popular social media applications globally. Also, 
Meta's scale in the social media business is staggering. Almost 4 billion people use at least one of its 
applications every month. For context, according to various estimates, a little more than 5 billion people 
in the world have access to the internet, implying that around 75% of people connected to the internet 
globally are users of Meta's applications. 
The vast majority of Meta's massive user base across its application ecosystem uses its applications 
free of charge. Instead of paying Meta a subscription fee to use its applications, they provide Meta with 
an audience that it can sell advertisements to. Meta can accumulate data on users, such as 
demographic information, likes/dislikes, and topics of interest to feed into its advertising engine, which 
lets advertisers target ads placed on Meta's properties. 
We view Meta's collection, storage, and subsequent monetization of this rich, high-quality data as an 
intangible asset that provides the firm with a meaningful competitive advantage over other social 
media platforms and advertising venues. This data, and the ad technology and algorithms built on top 
of it, provide Meta a peerless position when it comes to monetizing its large user base. Further, as 
Meta's data collection and ad-targeting algorithms have gotten better, the firm has also flexed its 
pricing power. A prime example of this pricing power, and the increasingly strong value proposition the 
firm offers advertisers, is the rapid growth in Meta's average ad revenue per user, which has increased 
to more than $40 globally at the end of 2023 from around $25 in 2018.
Further, Meta's ad-targeting and content recommendation algorithms improve as more users give it 
their data by using its applications. This dynamic creates a potent network effect with the value of its 
application ecosystem increasing as more people use it. These network effects serve to create barriers

to success for new social network upstarts, who would start off subscale, as well as barriers to exit for 
existing users who might leave behind friends, contacts, pictures, memories, and more by completely 
departing to alternative applications such as Snapchat or TikTok.
Meta has leveraged its scale and large installed base to create new avenues of user engagement that 
directly compete with applications that stand to threaten its social media dominance. When threatened 
by Snapchat, Meta launched Stories, a Snapchat copycat, that allows FoA users to post short picture or 
video collections that disappear after 24 hours. Similarly, when threatened by TikTok and its engaging 
short-form video content, Meta rolled out Reels, a short-form video offering nearly identical to TikTok. 
While Stories and Reels can be seen as defensive maneuvers aimed to keep users on Meta’s 
applications, Meta has demonstrated its ability to use this copycat model as an offensive, land-grab 
strategy as well. When Twitter/X was undergoing substantial turmoil following Elon Musk's takeover of 
the platform, Meta launched Threads, a Twitter/X copycat. In all three cases, Stories, Reels, and Threads, 
Meta has been able to create strong, monetizable products that have hundreds of millions of users 
across them. We believe Meta’s ability to weaponize its scale as a competitive advantage makes the 
economic moat around its business more durable.
Meta's scale is also important when contextualizing the firm's ongoing investments in AI. Meta's capital 
expenditure, mostly on data centers equipped with expensive graphics processing units, has led 
investors to question whether the firm's investments in AI will yield meaningful results and generate 
returns in excess of the firm's cost of capital. When discerning the impact of these AI investments on 
Meta's return on invested capital profile and its durable competitive advantage and differentiation, we 
see positives and negatives. 
On the positive side, the firm could leverage AI to improve its ad tech business, improving advertiser 
ROI and encouraging more ad dollars to be spent on its platform. Investments in AI that serve this end 
are, in our view, explicitly value-accretive. By investing within its moat, Meta could leverage its AI 
infrastructure to further pull away from competition by driving a higher ad revenue per user in its 
highly profitable ad business. However, investments to drive better ad targeting are nothing new. Also, 
the firm's AI investments could be leveraged to drive more engaging content for its end users on 
Facebook and Instagram. Again, such investments in better user engagement are ultimately value-
accretive as they increase Meta's value to advertisers who can place ads for more engaged users. 
On the other hand, the firm's investments in generative AI and its push to have Llama as the chatbot of 
choice for its users don't inspire the same confidence in us. First, the firm lacks any meaningful 
monetization strategy around its chatbot. We understand that if users have a competent chatbot within 
their Meta application of choice they don't need to leave Meta's properties, boosting time spent on 
Meta's application ecosystem. However, at the same time we'd imagine it'd be significantly cheaper for

Meta to have a licensing agreement with a company like OpenAI/Anthropic/Perplexity, which could 
provide Meta with chatbots that would have the same end user-engagement result. 
Also, we see the investments that public cloud vendors are making in AI as beneficial for public cloud 
infrastructure providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Meta, on the other hand, does not have a 
presence in the public cloud market and isn't planning to become a public cloud vendor either. As a 
result, it strikes us as odd that the company would invest billions of dollars in developing a technology 
that doesn't have an obvious monetization strategy behind it. In sum, while we like Meta's investments 
in AI as they relate to the firm's core advertising business, we remain skeptical of the long-term value 
added by the firm’s investments in user-facing chatbots. 
Reality Labs
We believe Meta's Reality Labs business merits a no moat rating. While the firm's investments in 
metaverse and virtual/augmented reality could lead to profitable growth in the future, the segment 
continues to burn capital for Meta, with the segment’s operating losses exceeding $16 billion in 2023. 
Due to its insignificant size, as a proportion of Meta's overall business, it does not preclude us from 
viewing the overall firm as having a wide moat.
Fair Value and Profit Drivers Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
Our fair value estimate for Meta is $850 per share, implying a 2026 adjusted price/earnings multiple of 
30 times and an enterprise value/adjusted EBITDA multiple of 14 times. 
We forecast Meta's sales growing at a 18% compound annual growth rate for the next five years, 
spearheaded primarily by an increase in average revenue per user, with user growth also chipping in. 
Drilling deeper, we believe Meta has a strong monetization opportunity ahead of it in Asia and the rest 
of the world. While we expect advertising sales from North America and Europe to grow steadily, we 
believe increasingly affluent and growing middle classes in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East will allow 
Meta to improve its ad monetization in those regions, lifting its overall top line. 
While we expect Reality Labs sales to grow at a double-digit rate over the next five years, we believe 
Meta’s advertising juggernaut will remain the primary driver of its business and intrinsic value over our 
explicit forecast. 
On the profitability side, we remain impressed by Meta’s ability to drive efficiency across its operational 
footprint, with the firm’s 2025 operating margins of 41%, up from the 2022 nadir of 25%. Looking ahead, 
we believe that the firm’s profitability will deteriorate, with operating margins declining to 39% over our 
explicit five-year forecast as increased compensation and depreciation costs eat away at the strong top-
line growth.

Risk and Uncertainty Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
We assign Meta a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of High. We believe Meta’s investments in 
unprofitable ventures such as generative AI and Reality Labs add a layer of uncertainty around its 
business, even as its large and stable advertising business continues to generate substantial cash flows 
in our forecast. 
As we look ahead, we believe Meta’s considerable scale and intangible assets, such as its ad-targeting 
algorithms, will most likely enable the firm to maintain its dominance in the social media space. While 
there are antitrust concerns around Meta’s business, with US antitrust regulators pursuing a monopoly 
case against the firm, we view an often-hypothesized breakup of Meta’s applications into separate 
businesses as unlikely. At the same time, there is headline risk that the firm faces as the case moves 
through the courts with a trial likely starting in 2025. 
Beyond advertising, Meta’s investments in Reality Labs and generative AI, primarily via its Llama LLM, 
add uncertainty to the firm's overall business. Along with losing Meta billions of dollars every year, a 
profitable monetization strategy for both investments remains elusive. While the firm has shown a 
panache of proving investors and analysts wrong with large business decisions in the past, we remain 
uncertain about the long-term value accretion these investments stand to provide Meta. 
The firm’s high dependence on user behavior data represents an environmental, social, and governance 
risk. If it fails to maintain adequate data privacy and security, Meta’s advertising business will likely 
suffer. Also, the broader impact of social media on its users’ mental health, especially that of teenagers, 
is also a pertinent ESG risk for Meta. There appears to be bipartisan support in the US for increased 
regulation of social media platforms that could include forcing Meta to change its content 
recommendation algorithms, potentially hitting the firm’s advertising business.
Capital Allocation Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA, Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
We assign Meta a Standard Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating based on its sound balance sheet, 
fair investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions. 
Meta's balance sheet remains enviable, especially given that digital advertising has not been very 
cyclical thus far. Meta's leverage ratios remain exceptionally strong, with $23 billion in net cash and 
cash equivalents as of the end of 2025. 
Meta's research and development investments over the past decade have largely been value-accretive 
as the firm has been able to drive user growth while also improving monetization across its 
applications. While some recent R&D investments, particularly in Reality Labs, have been more 
questionable, we find the firm's internal investment strategy solid. With its large amount of cash, Meta 
is well positioned to make additional investments primarily by building out new features and products

that drive increased user engagement. 
Coupled with investments within the business, previous acquisitions have strengthened the firm’s 
network effect moat source and accelerated top-line growth, most notably including Instagram and 
WhatsApp. The management team—more specifically, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg—has 
demonstrated its focus on long-term returns on investments, which we view as positive. 
However, at the same time we believe that combative antitrust regulators scrutinizing Meta’s every 
move and an ongoing monopoly case against the firm make it unlikely that Meta will be able to engage 
in any blockbuster mergers and acquisitions in the near future. 
We also applaud management’s walled-garden strategy as it continues to protect the firm’s most 
valuable asset, its user base and usage data. However, the US and other governments around the world 
may also impose restrictions on Meta’s use of user data. Management has responded well as it 
continues to increase its influence in Washington, D.C. 
In terms of shareholder distributions, Meta declared a dividend for the first time in the first quarter of 
2024. The firm has repurchased shares consistently, spending $19.8 billion,$30 billion, and $27 billion in 
2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. 
Our main knock on Meta’s management is its use of a multiple share class structure that may limit the 
voice of minority shareholders. This has become more of an issue given how Meta is addressing data 
privacy and security, which has led to some shareholders wanting to reduce Zuckerberg's control of the 
company. Some continue to believe that Zuckerberg's control of Meta creates a conflict of interest, 
allowing him to pursue passion projects whether or not they have the potential to generate exceptional 
returns for shareholders.

Meta Earnings: Ad Engine Firing on All Cylinders Even as AI Costs Mount; FVE up to $850 From $770
Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA,Equity Analyst,31 Jul 2025
Meta closed the second quarter of fiscal 2025 with excellent financial results which included sales 
growing 22% to $47.5 billion and operating margins rising 500 basis points to 43%. The firm's capital 
expenditures for 2025 are expected to reach $69 billion, up from $68 billion previously estimated. Why it 
matters: Meta's primary ad business continues to churn out billions of dollars in free cash flow that the 
firm is spending on its artificial intelligence ambitions. We remain enthusiastic about Meta's ability to 
drive better engagement and monetization on its social media platforms by leveraging AI tools. While 
investors have been concerned this year about macro headwinds and their impact on Meta's digital ad 
sales, we continue to view the firm's ad business as resilient. We attribute this resilience to the firm's 
superior return on ad spending that continues to attract customers. Meta's strategy of using AI tools to 
drive better engagement and monetization of its platforms continues to go strong. Meta saw more time

spent on Instagram and Facebook, more advertisers using AI creative tools, and AI-improved ad 
recommendations leading to higher conversion rates. The bottom line: We are raising our fair value 
estimate for wide-moat Meta to $850 from $770 as we factor in the strong quarterly performance as 
well as higher top-line growth due to continued AI-led improvements in user engagement and ad 
monetization. With shares trading up sharply following the earnings result, we view them as marginally 
undervalued relative to our updated fair value. Between the lines: With Instagram and Facebook well-
saturated with ads, Meta has begun ads on Threads and WhatsApp as it looks to increase its ad supply, 
which should boost sales over time. We see this move as value-accretive as the firm increases its ad 
surfaces and monetization simultaneously. 
Meta: Ads on WhatsApp Stand to Add Incremental Ad Inventory, Supporting Top-Line Growth Malik 
Ahmed Khan, CFA,Equity Analyst,16 Jun 2025
On June 16, Meta announced that the company will begin placing ads on WhatsApp, a messaging app 
with over 3 billion monthly users. The ads will show up on the Updates tab, a WhatsApp feature used by 
more than 1.5 billion users daily. Why it matters: To increase ad sales, Meta has two primary levers: 
price and volume. While price can be indirectly increased over time by honing algorithms to increase 
return on ad spending, Meta has more explicit control over volume, as it can choose to surface more ads 
on its platform. With ad loads, or the number of ads shown, quite high on saturated products such as 
Facebook and Instagram, Meta has increasingly looked for new pieces of digital real estate to show ads. 
After Meta announced plans for ads on Threads earlier this year, WhatsApp is next on the monetization 
schedule. Meta has a proven track record of gradually monetizing its applications after building up a 
strong, sticky user base. While WhatsApp's monetization timeline has been significantly longer than 
that of other apps and products, such as Threads, Stories, and Reels, we view Meta's change as a 
strategic move. The bottom line: We maintain our $770 fair value estimate for wide-moat Meta, with 
WhatsApp monetization already baked into our growth forecasts. With shares trading up on the news of 
WhatsApp monetization, we view them as marginally undervalued. With the firm claiming only to use 
data such as location, language, and interactions with ads to show ads on WhatsApp, we believe 
WhatsApp monetization will likely lag that of Instagram and Facebook. Those apps have vastly more 
data that can improve the return on ads for advertisers. Further, while WhatsApp has more than 3 
billion monthly users, a considerable portion of them reside in low- low-monetization geographies, 
further damping the average revenue per user profile of WhatsApp. 
Meta: Investment in Scale AI Underscores the Value of Data in Large Language Model Development 
Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA,Equity Analyst,9 Jun 2025
Over the weekend, multiple news outlets reported that Meta was looking to invest around $10 billion in 
Scale AI, a startup that provides data labelling services to model developers. Scale AI's most recent 
funding round, back in 2024, valued the firm at $14 billion. Why it matters: A $10 billion investment by

Meta would be the largest external investment the firm has made in artificial intelligence, underscoring 
the need for high-quality data to train leading frontier models such as Llama 4. Scale AI's services have 
been instrumental in training specialized models, focused on deeper research areas in science and 
math. Within Scale AI's pool of contributors that check and rank model performance, 12% hold PhDs 
and 40% hold graduate degrees such as MBA, JD, etc. Scale AI's highly skilled network could be valuable 
for Meta, especially as the firm seeks to catch up to Alphabet, OpenAI, and Anthropic, labs that currently 
have more advanced models than Meta. The bottom line: Before this blockbuster investment, Meta was 
a Scale AI investor in prior funding rounds, although the specific amounts haven't been disclosed. We 
don't view these investments as having an impact on our $770 fair value estimate for wide-moat Meta. 
With Scale AI expecting $2 billion in sales this year, we estimate the firm's valuation to be likely north of 
$80 billion, using a 40 times price/sales multiple, roughly in line with other AI startups. A $10 billion 
investment, not counting Meta's existing stake in Scale AI, would likely yield a post-money stake of 
loosely 10%. Having a material equity stake in an AI startup is quite common for large tech firms, with 
OpenAI and Anthropic both attracting large investments by big tech firms. Between the lines: Typically, 
public cloud providers' investments in AI firms include cloud credits that prevent large cash outflows. 
Meta, on the other hand, doesn't have a cloud business, meaning that the investment is likely going to 
pure cash transaction. 
Meta Earnings: Ad Spending on Meta Shows Resilience Even as Macro Dark Clouds Gather Malik 
Ahmed Khan, CFA,Equity Analyst,1 May 2025
Meta kicked off fiscal 2025 with a set of strong financial results and better-than-expected outlook for 
second-quarter sales as ad spending on the firm's platform remains solid. On the profitability front, 
Meta's operating margins expanded 360 basis points in the quarter to 41%. Why it matters: Meta's ad 
business, aided by the firm's investments in improved ad targeting and content recommendation, 
continues to show resilience even as macro headwinds affect overall ad spending. We attribute this 
resilience to Meta's superior return on ad spending when compared with smaller peers. We believe 
these advertisers are reallocating ad dollars from lower-ROAS vendors like Snap, as seen in the firm's 
uncertain outlook reported yesterday. Also, in an auction-based pricing model, ad prices are 
automatically lowered as demand falls, enticing more advertisers looking to place an ad at a cheaper 
price. This flexibility, coupled with a broad client base, partially insulates Meta's revenues from 
dropping sharply. The bottom line: We are maintaining our $770 fair value estimate for wide-moat Meta 
and continue to view the firm as exceptionally well-placed to benefit from increased digital ad spending 
on social networks and from the firm's improved ad targeting due to its artificial intelligence-related 
investments. Investors have shied away from Meta's stock amid macrouncertainty. As evidenced by 
Alphabet's results last week, as well as Meta's report, large advertising giants are feeling the macro 
pain less than their smaller counterparts as the latter do not have the same level of ad-targeting 
sophistication. Despite the positive price action after the earnings report, we continue to view Meta's

stock as undervalued. We think investors are discounting the long-term competitive differentiation and 
value the firm stands to generate as it monetizes its AI investments. 
Meta: Don't Let the Market Turmoil Mask Meta's Latest LLM; Stock Undervalued Malik Ahmed Khan, 
CFA,Equity Analyst,7 Apr 2025
On April 4, Meta released Llama 4 LLM, its next-generation large language model with the ability to 
understand and generate content across various formats such as text, images, and video. Why it 
matters: With leading artificial intelligence labs continuing to invest billions of dollars in frontier 
models, we see the models being commodified over time, with all leading-edge models offering a 
similar slate of capabilities. We see Llama 4 as roughly at-par with the latest models by Google and 
OpenAI. Over time, we believe the current model-based competition in AI will give way to distribution 
and monetization-based competition. As the competitive dynamics of AI shift, we believe Meta, with its 
unrivalled user and creator base, can effectively distribute and monetize its GenAI investments. We see 
Meta's GenAI models being leveraged by creators and advertisers to create hyper-personalized content 
for users, which should also benefit user engagement and monetization over time. We see Llama 4, and 
its multimodal capabilities, as a step in this direction. The bottom line: We maintain our $770 fair value 
estimate for wide-moat Meta and view the stock as materially undervalued, with a $500 stock price 
implying a 20 times adjusted price/forward earnings multiple. While a tariff-induced macro slowdown 
could depress advertising spending, a great deal of uncertainty remains on how long lasting these US 
tariffs will be. In the case that the US tariffs persist and invoke a retaliatory response from key markets 
for Meta, such as Europe, we'd expect a 15% fair value estimate decrease as near-term revenue comes 
under material pressure. Even if this were to transpire, Meta would screen as undervalued. Between the 
lines: While the broader macro outlook remains dreary, we believe the near-term uncertainty around 
TikTok's US operations could bring in additional dollars to Meta's ad business, possibly alleviating some 
of the tariff-induced advertising spending pains. 
Meta Earnings: Record Profitability Makes for a Strong Finish in Fiscal 2024; FVE to $770 From $590
Malik Ahmed Khan, CFA,Equity Analyst,30 Jan 2025
Meta reported strong fourth-quarter financial results, with the firm's sales growing 21% year over year 
to $46.8 billion and operating margins expanding 700 basis points year over year to 48%. Why it 
matters: Meta's advertising behemoth surpassed our expectations on both the top and bottom line. We 
were impressed by Meta's ad impression and price-per-ad growth, with both metrics expanding in the 
fourth quarter. We view Meta as carefully leveraging its investments in artificial intelligence to improve 
both its content recommendation and ad-monetization models, with the firm's strong ad sales 
supporting the argument that these investments are already bearing fruit. As a testament to the 
enduring appeal of its platform, Meta's global user count ticked up yet another 5% year over year to 3.35 
billion. Alongside adding users, Meta's monetization improved as well, with the firm's average revenue

per user growing an impressive 16% year over year. The bottom line: We raise our fair value estimate 
for wide-moat Meta to $770 from $590, with shares now screening as marginally undervalued. The bulk 
of our fair value increase stems from a revised growth outlook for the firm and a more optimistic view of 
its generative AI investments. We are already seeing Meta's generative AI tools garner adoption on the 
advertising side, with more than 4 million advertisers using the firm's AI tools to create ad campaigns, 
up from 1 million six months ago. On the ad-targeting side, Meta disclosed increased ad quality by 
leveraging an AI-powered ad ranking system that was able to better personalize ads shown to users. 
Key stats: While Meta's record operating margin of 48% for the fourth quarter is impressive on its own, 
the firm's operating profitability for its core Family of Apps segment was even better, with FoA 
operating margins coming in at 60%, up 600 basis points year over year. K

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projec-
tion of a company’s future cash flows, resulting from our 
analysts’ research. Analysts create custom industry and 
company assumptions to feed income statement, balance 
sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our glob-
ally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or 
DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical tools to augment this process. Moreover, we 
think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows 
presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies, 
high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g., 
mines), or companies expected to generate negative 
earnings over the next few years. That said, we don’t dis-
miss multiples altogether but rather use them as sup-
porting cross-checks for our DCF-based fair value estim-
ates. We also acknowledge that DCF models offer their 
own challenges (including a potential proliferation of es-
timated inputs and the possibility that the method may 
miss shortterm market-price movements), but we believe 
these negatives are mitigated by deep analysis and our 
longterm approach.
Morningstar’s equity research group (”we,” “our”) be-
lieves that a company’s intrinsic worth results from the 
future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premi-
um to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in 
Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the 
biggest risk adjusted discount to their fair values, where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic 
worth.
Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) 
our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our es-
timate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around 
that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. 
This process ultimately culminates in our singlepoint star 
rating.
1. Economic Moat
The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not 
only in our qualitative assessment of a firm’s long-term 
investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of 
our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural 
feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a 
long period of time. We define economic profits as re-
turns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our es-
timate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost 
of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more 
susceptible to competition. We have identified five 
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are 
more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns 
for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are 
those in which we have very high confidence that excess 
returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more 
likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer 
a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic 
value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will 
see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.
When considering a company's moat, we also assess 
whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, 
stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, 
financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this con-
text, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if 
its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit 
on a cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the prob-
ability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not char-
acterize the company as possessing an economic moat.
2. Estimated Fair Value
Combining our analysts’ financial forecasts with the 
firm’s economic moat helps us assess how long returns 
on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm’s cost of 
capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rat-
ing are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a 
longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat 
firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:
Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts 
make full financial statement forecasts, including items 
such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in 
workingcapital accounts, and capital spending. Based on 
these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, 
after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.
Stage II: Fade
The second stage of our model is the period it will take 
the company’s return on new invested capital—the return 
on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to de-
cline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II 
period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in 
lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance 
sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The 
length of the second stage depends on the strength of the 
company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last 
anywhere from one year (for companies with no econom-
ic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat compan-
ies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four 
assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period, a normalized investment rate, average return on 
new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years 
until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The invest-
ment rate and return on new invested capital decline un-
til a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms 
that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal 
ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attribut-
able to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the 
second stage.
Stage III: Perpetuity
Once a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate a continuing value, using a standard per-
petuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any 
growth or decline or investment in the business neither 
creates nor destroys value and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.
Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash 
flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present 
value of expected future cash flows. Because we are 
modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash 
available to provide a return to all capital providers—we 
discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a 
weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and pre-
ferred stock (and any other funding sources), using ex-
pected future proportionate long-term, market-value 
weights.
3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate
Morningstar’s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture 
the range of potential outcomes for a company’s intrinsic 
value. This rating is used to assign the margin of safety 
required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives 
our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating is 
aimed at identifying the confidence we should have in as-
signing a fair value estimate for a given stock. 
Our Uncertainty Rating is meant to take into account any-
thing that can increase the potential dispersion of future

outcomes for the intrinsic value of a company, and any-
thing that can affect our ability to accurately predict 
these outcomes. The rating begins with a suggested rat-
ing produced by a quantitative process based on the 
trailing 12-month standard deviation of daily stock re-
turns. An analyst overlay is then applied, with analysts 
using the suggested rating, historical rating data, and 
their own knowledge of the company to inform them as 
they make the final Uncertainty Rating decision. Ulti-
mately, the rating decision rests with the analyst. Ana-
lysts take into account many characteristics when mak-
ing their final decision, including cyclical factors, opera-
tional and financial factors such as leverage, company-
specific events, ESG risks, and anything else that might 
increase the potential dispersion of future outcomes and 
our ability to estimate those outcomes. 
Our recommended margin of safety—the discount to fair 
value demanded before we’d recommend buying or 
selling the stock—widens as our uncertainty of the estim-
ated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain we 
are about the potential dispersion of outcomes, the great-
er the discount we require relative to our estimate of the 
value of the firm before we would recommend the pur-
chase of the shares. In addition, the Uncertainty Rating 
provides guidance in portfolio construction based on risk 
tolerance. 
Our Uncertainty Ratings are: Low, Medium, High, Very 
High, and Extreme.

Our uncertainty rating is based on the interquartile 
range, or the middle 50% of potential outcomes, covering 
the 25th percentile–75th percentile. This means that 
when a stock hits 5 stars, we expect there is a 75% 
chance that the intrinsic value of that stock lies above the 
current market price. Similarly, when a stock hits 1 star, 
we expect there is a 75% chance that the intrinsic value 
of that stock lies below the current market price.
4. Market Price
The market prices used in this analysis and noted in the 
report come from exchange on which the stock is listed 
which we believe is a reliable source.

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we 
compare it with the stock’s current market price on a 
daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calcu-
lated at the market close on every day the market on 
which the stock is listed is open. Our analysts keep close 
tabs on the companies they follow, and, based on thor-
ough and ongoing analysis, raise or lower their fair value 
estimates as warranted.
Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars. 
That is, the percentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can 
fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can 
serve as a gauge of the broader market’s valuation. When 
there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole 
is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few 
companies garner our highest rating.
We expect that if our base-case assumptions are true the 
market price will converge on our fair value estimate over 
time generally within three years (although it is im-
possible to predict the exact time frame in which market 
prices may adjust).
Our star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and 
individuals must consider their own specific investment 
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income 
needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other 
factors.
The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined be-
low:
QQQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk ad-
justed return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. 
Scenario analysis developed by our analysts indicates 
that the current market price represents an excessively 
pessimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximiz-
ing upside potential.
QQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-ad-
justed return is likely.
QQQ Indicates our belief that investors are likely to re-
ceive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of 
equity).
QQ We believe investors are likely to receive a less than 
fair risk-adjusted return.
Q Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjus-
ted returns from the current market price over a multi-
year time frame, based on our analysis. Scenario analysis 
by our analysts indicates that the market is pricing in an 
excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential 
and leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

and shareholder distributions. Analysts consider com-
panies’ investment strategy and valuation, balance sheet 
management, and dividend and share buyback policies. 
Corporate governance factors are only considered if they 
are likely to materially impact shareholder value, though 
either the balance sheet, investment, or shareholder dis-
tributions. Analysts assign one of three ratings: "Exem-
plary", "Standard", or "Poor". Analysts judge Capital Alloc-
ation from an equity holder’s perspective. Ratings are de-
termined on a forward looking and absolute basis. The 
Standard rating is most common as most managers will 
exhibit neither exceptionally strong nor poor capital al-
location.
Capital Allocation (or Stewardship) analysis published 
prior to Dec. 9, 2020, was determined using a different 
process. Beyond investment strategy, financial leverage, 
and dividend and share buyback policies, analysts also 
considered execution, compensation, related party trans-
actions, and accounting practices in the rating.
Capital Allocation Rating: Our Capital Allocation (or 
Stewardship) Rating represents our assessment of the 
quality of management’s capital allocation, with particu-
lar emphasis on the firm’s balance sheet, investments, 
and shareholder distributions. Analysts consider com-
panies’ investment strategy and valuation, balance sheet 
management, and dividend and share buyback policies.

Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating Assessment:The ESG 
Risk Rating Assessment is provided by Sustainalytics; a 
Morningstar company.
Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Ratings measure the degree to 
which company’s economic value at risk is driven by en-
vironment, social and governance (ESG) factors.
Sustainalytics analyzes over 1,300 data points to assess a 
company’s exposure to and management of ESG risks. In 
other words, ESG Risk Ratings measures a company’s un-
managed ESG Risks represented as a quantitative score. 
Unmanaged Risk is measured on an open-ended scale 
starting at zero (no risk) with lower scores representing 
less unmanaged risk and, for 95% of cases, the unman-
aged ESG Risk score is below 50.
Based on their quantitative scores, companies are 
grouped into one of five Risk Categories (negligible, low, 
medium, high, severe). These risk categories are absolute, 
meaning that a ‘high risk’ assessment reflects a compar-
able degree of unmanaged ESG risk across all subindus-
tries covered.
The ESG Risk Rating Assessment is a visual representa-
tion of Sustainalytics ESG Risk Categories on a 1 to 5 
scale. Companies with Negligible Risk = 5 Globes, Low 
Risk = 4, Medium Risk = 3 Globes, High Risk = 2 Globes, 
Severe Risk = 1 Globe. For more information, please visit 
sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings/
Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluat-
ing a company or security. Ratings involve unknown risks 
and uncertainties which may cause our expectations not 
to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected 
and should not be considered an offer or solicitation to 
buy or sell a security.
Risk Warning
Please note that investments in securities are subject to 
market and other risks and there is no assurance or guar-
antee that the intended investment objectives will be 
achieved. Past performance of a security may or may not 
be sustained in future and is no indication of future per-
formance. A security investment return and an investor’s 
principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an 
investor’s shares may be worth more or less than their 
original cost. A security’s current investment perform-
ance may be lower or higher than the investment per-
formance noted within the report. Morningstar’s Uncer-
tainty Rating serves as a useful data point with respect to 
sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in our de-
termining a fair value price.
