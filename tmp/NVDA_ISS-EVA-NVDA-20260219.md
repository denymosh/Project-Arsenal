Each column in the EVA Income Statement  above represents a TFQ (trailing four quarter) period. Pure cash operating costs (excluding depreciation, rent, Ad&Promo, R&D are 
subtracted from revenue to determine EBITDAR. Each line item is shown as a % of sales. Below the EBITDAR line, a capital charge is assessed for all balance sheet assets. R&D and 
Ad&Promo which were removed from SG&A are capitalized and shown in the Intangible Capital line item (along with other non-goodwill intangibles, if any). Other EVA represents 
non-operating items such as deferred revenue, deferred taxes, minority interests, equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries, pension items, and funding from other liabilities. EVA 
Effective Tax Rate includes a smoothing mechanism which adjusts for variability in taxes paid.  
Capital (blue bars, above left) = Sum of all funds raised from debt and equity sources + retained earnings which is now funding the firm’s net assets. Includes adjustments for capitalizing R&D, etc.
CVA (red bars, above left) = Current Value Added and represents the EVA generated in the current period, capitalized at the cost of capital as a perpetuity. Height of bar shows the value of the company 
assuming no future growth.
FVA (gray bars, above left) = Future Value Added. Represents the present value of future EVA implied by the current market value (market value is the dashed line). When FVA is positive, the market 
expects and is pricing in the company to generate additional EVA in the future. When negative the market expects profits to erode.
Future Growth Reliance (blue line, above right) represents the amount of FVA as a % of total market value. How much value is at risk (or attributed to) EVA creation in the future. Comparing to history 
is also useful.

PRVit Overview:
PRVit ("prove-it) is the" performance-risk-valuation investment technology from ISS EVA.
It is a purely quantitative rating of a stock's alpha potential. It is based on a daily statistical analysis of the financial results and market valuations of all Russell Global or Russell 3000 stocks. PRVit uses a 
total of 22 individual measures to assess the essence of performance trends, risk exposures, and valuation multiples.  The individual measures are combined into 6 component scores, which in turn sum 
to the composite performance, risk and valuation scores, as follows:  
Profitability (P) is a function of:
Profitability Level:  as indicated by EVA Margin (EVA as a percent of sales) and EVA Spread (EVA as a percent of capital)
Profitability Trend:  as indicated by EVA Momentum (the change in EVA, as percent of trailing sales and capital, and over the past quarter, year, and 3 years trend)
Risk (R) is a function of:
Variability:  as indicated by the standard deviation in the firm's share price and its EVA Margin
Vulnerability:  as indicated by weak free cash flow and operating cash generation, and an extended debt repayment horizon
Valuation (V) is a function of:
Wealth Ratios:  as indicated by market-to-book ratios, specifically, by MVA Margin (MVA as a percent of sales) and MVA Spread (MVA as a percent of capital)
Wealth Multiples:  as indicated by market value multiples of EBITDAR and NOPAT, and by Future Growth Reliance (FGR) -- the percent of market value above the capitalized value of EVA. 
The table below illustrates the elements entering the P score for Brothers Industries Limited, a Japanese Technology Hardware and Equipment Company, as October 3, 2012. The firm's overall score at 
the time was pegged at 81 -- meaning PRVit judged its performance better than 8 out of 10 companies on the market.  
Brother's overall Profitability Score (P) is a combination of firm's underlying Profitability Level Score (P1) -- which registers at the 71st percentile -- and its EVA growth rate, i.e., its Profitability Trend 
Score (P2) -- which clocks in at a middling 56th percentile -- when compared against other firms in the same industry.  Comparisons vs. +16,500 firms tracked in the ISS EVA global database, which is 
updated daily, are also available.   The composite Performance grade is a statistical average of the two components scores, and for Brother is pegged at the 70th percentile.  
Looking at the underlying details, i.e., the individual metrics that make up those P scores, Brother is a middle of the road performer in almost every respect.   Its EVA Profit Margin (EVA/Sales) was 
0.1% over the most recent trailing four quarter period (Japanese companies report semi-annually, but each such period is automatically converted into two quarters in the data base permitting the 
construction of running 4 quarter years) which is in the 69th percentile vs. its industry.   Its EVA/Capital return spread of 0.2% was likewise above average, in the 71st percentile. Brother's EVA trend is 
more a mixed bag. Its annual EVA Momentum growth rate -- as measured by the increase in its EVA over the prior trailing 4 quarters compared to the four quarters before that, divided by its capital 4 
quarters back -- was 0.2%, a 26th percentile performance.   But its EVA Momentum was distinctly better (and positive) over the past 3 year trend (which is based on the regression slope through the 
past four year's of EVA) but it was negative, disturbingly, for the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter the year before.  Combining all three Momentum sensors -- strategic, annual, and 
tactical -- yields a net Trend Score at the 56th percentile, again, quite quotidian.   And that, coupled with its slightly more inspiring 71st percentile Profitability score, put Brother in the 70th percentile 
bin of economic profit performers across global firms in the same industry.  A similar comparative rating process is followed to generate a composite R score and V score, based on the relevant set of 
indicative measures for each.  A PRVit "Global Score" is at last determined by computing the ratio of (P-R)/V, and expressing that as a percentile against the ratio computed for all 9,000 global firms.  
More formally, PRVit is the ratio of the firm's intrinsic value to its actual market valuation:

It asks the key question: Is a company truly worth more -- or less -- than its current market valuation, when compared to the valuation of all companies?  
PRVit answers the question by using recent past EVA performance and profitability trends, net of risk -- or P-R -- as a proxy for the firm's intrinsic value, and comparing that with the firm's actual 
market valuation score. Firms with high scores are attractively priced relative to intrinsic value, and are expected to outperform stocks with lower PRVit scores.  
The PRVit Matrix shown on the upper right corner of the chart below  is a visual representation of how PRVit rates stocks against the global universe (or US universe for US companies) according to 
VARP.   It plots a firm's intrinsic value, as indicated by its comparative P-R score, on the "Y" axis, and plots the firm's actual valuation score on the horizontal, with valuation scores plotting backwards -- 
increasing from right to left.  "Holds" plot on the diagonal -- where actual market valuations are in close accord with their true intrinsic values. "Buys" plot in the upper right, blue zone, where intrinsic 
value scores outpace the actual valuation multiples. "Sells" land in the lower left red zone, where the firms' actual trading values overstate intrinsic values.  Let's see how this applies to Brother.

According to PRVit, relative to all global firms in the same industry, Brother trades at a notable discount to its intrinsic value, once risk and valuation are considered.  It's Risk profile is low -- just 34th 
percentile.   Stock price and EVA profit margin are quite stable.   The company also generates reasonably strong cash flow, and is conservatively financed -- all debt and leases could be paid off in under 
3 months from pre-tax operating cash flow.  The combination of P-R -- an indication of the firm's risk adjusted EVA performance -- is therefore higher than P alone, in fact, it qualifies Brother for an 
above-average, 69th percentile "intrinsic value score," as is plotted on the vertical axis of the "heat map" grid in the upper right corner of the chart above. 
The surprise is that at report time Brother trades for a very depressed set of valuation ratios that appear, statistically, out of whack with its intrinsic P-R score.   For one, Brother trades for a negligible 
MVA premium over its invested capital, when with a decent positive EVA, a decent positive MVA premium would appear warranted (because after all, a company's franchise value, or, MVA, should 
equal the present value of its EVA).   What's worse -- or better if you are an investor -- the company's actual market value is 59% lower than it should be based simply on the value of extrapolating its 
current EVA profit as a perpetuity (Future Growth Reliance).  There's no escaping the fact that the stock is priced conservatively -- in fact it is priced for an expected deterioration in EVA -- which 
translates into a composite Valuation score of just the 20th percentile compared to all equities on the global market, which is plotted from right to left on the upper heat map.  The intersection 
positions Brother's at a point in the upper right green zone corresponding to a PRVit "Global" score of 93 -- which corresponds to a very solid, strong BUY rating.  Or does it? 
The answer is actually "no" -- at least not according to PRVit. At the time, Japanese stocks as a group and Tech Hardware stocks as a group were highly rated by PRVit relative to other countries and sub-
sectors, respectively.   Through a daily-updated regression analysis, an estimate is made of the country and sub-sector influence that is implicitly factored into the rating of each individual stock.   As of 
this report date, Japanese stocks (after abstracting from their sub-sector exposures) were rated a full 14 PRVit points higher than the global median, and Tech Hardware firms (after abstracting from 
their home country influence) were generally rated 1 point higher.  Thus, a new PRVit "Prime" score, purged of country and industry influence is computed according to the formula: 
Brother's PRVit Prime score is only 83, less than its basic Global Score of 93, once the country and sub-sector influence are removed, and accounting statistically for their interaction (an effect which is 
not specifically reported for each stock but is implicitly in its PRVit Prime score).    When the dust settles, PRVit Prime is a measure of the pure over- or under- valuation of a stock that cannot be 
arbitraged or replicated by just taking positions in country or sub-sector ETFs.  And on that purified "Prime" score, Brother still remains attractively priced, even after accounting for the fact that its raw 
Global PRVit score is inflated for all Japanese stocks and all global Tech Hardware stocks -- just not as attractively priced. 
The above "Prime" score calculation is utilized for non-US companies to account for country influence. For US companies, in addition to ranking vs. the Russell 3000 as a whole, a second PRVit score is 
computed for each company -- one that removes the general PRVit rating for the firm's industry group as a whole. First, all companies in each of 55 industry groups are ranked according to their PRVit 
market scores (vs. the Russell 3000). Then they are then assigned a PRVit "in-industry" score according to their percentile rank against their industry peers. The top-rated firm in every industry group is 
thus assigned an in-industry PRVit score of 100, the lowest rated one a score of 0. All others are evenly spaced in between. In-industry PRVit scores are better guides as to which stocks to buy and 
which to sell -- compared to the alternatives available within a given industry group than are the raw PRVit scores measured against the market as a whole. As such, this is the default score that is used 
to compute stock ratings.

Glossary of key terms and measures
Profitability Metrics
Return on Capital (ROC). ROC is  defined as net operating profit after taxes, or NOPAT, as a percentage of total capital employed. "Capital" is a firm’s total borrowings plus shareholders’ equity, or what 
is the same thing, it is its net operational assets – the sum of its working capital, fixed plant, equipment and property assets, and other assets, including intangibles. NOPAT is correspondingly the profit 
attributable to the capital – before deducting any interest or other financing expense –  which makes the ROC ratio of the two a reliable gauge of a firm’s ability to productively invest and manage the 
resources put at its disposal regardless of how the capital is financed. 
NOPAT and capital are also measured after making a series of corrective adjustments that undo accounting distortions. Accounting rules mandate, for example, that research and development and 
advertising spending be immediately written off against corporate earnings as the money is spent.  But in fact, such outlays are in the main vital investments that create new products,  improve 
productivity and increase brand value and customer satisfaction. Therefore, a new rule is followed to measure NOPAT and capital, which is to add the outlays to balance sheet assets and to write them 
off over a period of years -- generally 5 years for R&D and 3 years for ad spending.  That way, a sudden sharp boost in the spending doesn’t inexplicably diminish a company’s earnings and depress its 
ROC -- the cost is spread over time to match the expected benefits (and nor does a cutback appear as a misleading increase in earnings). Another advantage to following this rule is that the rate of 
return the firm is actually earning on its investments in innovation and in building brands can be more accurately gauged and reliably compared with other firms -- indeed, across firms operating in 
other industries that may differ in the degree of such spending on intangibles.  
The adjustments don’t stop there, of course.  Impairment charges are reversed, as if they did not happen.  Mere accounting strokes of the pen have no impact on ROC (or on EVA, for that matter).  In 
the same spirit, restructuring charges and asset write-downs are taken out of earnings, and added back to balance sheet capital, so that any additional money invested to streamline and restructure can 
be judged in terms of its return on investment, just like any other.  
Financial distortions, too, are purged.   Assets rented are added to capital as if they were owned, and the interest component of rent expense is added back to NOPAT.  Surplus cash and the related 
income are set aside, so that a massive cash distribution to investors, such as Microsoft undertook in 2004, has no effect on ROC (though it sends ROE – return on equity – haywire).  Period to period 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate, too, are smoothed to better reveal underlying profitability.  All told, some 50 adjustments are called into play to correct bookkeeping flaws.  
The result is that unlike the conventional ROE computed from reported financial figures, the ROC measure that EVA Dimensions’ uses enables more uniform and informative comparisons of 
performance over time for a given company, and across firms and industries that are inherently quite different in their business models and financial make-up. It neutralizes the varying degrees to which 
firms use intangible capital (like patents, know how, and brands) vs. tangible capital (inventories and plant), the mix of owning versus leasing assets, the mix of debt versus equity financing, and the 
extent of excess cash on hand, to name a few.  
Financial institutions require a special treatment.  Financing assets with appropriate funding sources is an operating decision for a financial intermediary, and interest expense is akin to cost of goods 
sold. Hence, funding sources like deposits, borrowed funds, and insurance reserves, are excluded from capital, and the associated interest expense is deducted from NOPAT.  In effect, net interest 
income is the equivalent of sales for an industrial company, and common equity capital (as adjusted) is the equivalent of “capital.”  
Economic Value Added (EVA). EVA is the name given to a special way of measuring corporate profit that follows economic logic rather than doggedly conforming to accounting rules.  The chief 
difference is that, under EVA, profit is measured after setting aside a minimum return to compensate shareholders for bearing risk, which is an invisible but nevertheless quite real “opportunity cost” 
that accounting records entirely overlook.  EVA recognizes that a firm isn’t really profitable until it earns at least the return that its shareholders could earn on their own by investing in an equally risky 
basket of stocks.  This one change means that many companies that appear to be profitable and profitably expanding when judged by their EBITDA, net income or EPS, aren’t really profitable at all 
when judged by the EVA standard. 
To be specific, EVA is computed as net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, less a “capital charge” computed by multiplying the firm’s capital by its overall, weighted average cost of debt and equity 
capital (a figure that is generally 6%-12% these days, depending on the risk of the firm).   EVA may also be thought of as the percent spread between a firm’s return on capital (ROC) and its overall cost 
of capital (COC), times the amount of capital it employs.  In other words, it is the dollar amount by which a firm's return on capital exceeds -- or falls short of -- its overall cost of capital.    
A firm’s EVA increases when it pares wasteful costs and boosts the ROC it is earning on its installed capital base, when it grows by investing new capital in projects and strategies that more than cover 
the threshold return, and when it releases capital that is not earnings its true cost – which happens when management improves asset turns, pares marginal lines of business or sells or outsources 
assets worth more to others. An increase in a firm’s EVA, even if it is just making a negative EVA less negative, is as sure a sign a company is making progress as generally exists, and that it is increasing 
the value of the firm above the capital invested in it, spread which goes by the name of MVA, standing for “market value added.”  EVA Momentum is a ratio that measures the rate of increase in EVA (as 
a percent of sales in the prior period).  
EVA Spread. The ratio of EVA/Capital measures the productivity of capital in generating economic profit.  It is mathematically the same as the percent spread between ROC and COC. 
EVA Margin. The ratio of EVA/Sales; it is the percentage of sales that ends up as EVA after all operating expenses, taxes, and capital charges have been paid. It is the single best measure of a company’s 
profit margin because it correctly and completely consolidates pricing power, operational efficiency and the quality of asset management into one overall score. 
In so doing, the EVA margin makes it possible to meaningfully compare asset light service businesses that require little capital, and which like Wal-Mart can generate an outstanding EVA with relatively 
meager operating margins, versus companies in asset intense industries, such as semiconductor fabricators or paper mill operators that must tie up significant capital to generate sales, and which 
therefore are obliged to earn far higher operating margins to cover the cost of their capital before they can begin to earn EVA.  
EVA Momentum. The change in a firm’s economic profit in a given period divided by its sales (or capital) in the prior period  (when divided by trailing sales, it is referred to as EVA Momentum Margin, 
and by capital, as EVA Momentum Spread)..  For example, a company that has 2009 sales of $100, and that increases EVA from $10 in 2009 to $11 in 2010 (or from -$6 to -$5 for that matter) generates 
1% EVA Momentum ($1/$100).  EVA Momentum indicates the rate of growth in economic profit, scaled to sales.  EVA Momentum can be measured by quarter (vs. the same quarter the prior year), 
year over year, or over a longer term horizon, such as the trailing three to five years.   It can be measured using actual EVA figures or using a trend line change. 
EVA Momentum is a very important metric.  For one thing, it is the only financial ratio where a bigger outcome is generally always better, because it increases when EVA does, which indicates the firm's 
net present value is expanding and that management is taking actions that make economic sense.  That cannot be said of margin, market share, growth rate, return on capital, or any other ratio metric.  
All of them can "improve" when a firm’s performance and value are actually deteriorating (see "EVA Momentum -- the one ratio that tells the whole story", by EVA Dimensions CEO Bennett Stewart, for 
more information; appearing in the Morgan Stanley Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Spring, 2009).  
Also, more than any other measure, EVA Momentum levels cross-company comparisons by scaling results according to size and also by concentrating on performance improvements – focusing on 
changes in EVA-which means that legacy assets or liabilities that are already reflected in the base level of EVA are ignored.   It is, for instance, positive for negative EVA businesses that are on the mend, 
and negative for positive EVA businesses that are slipping.  EVA Momentum is thus a financial “canary in the cave,” presciently signaling changes of direction in advance of conventional measures like 
EBITDA, EPS or ROE, which do not adequately charge profit for the use of investors’ capital.  
EVA Momentum is always the sum of two overarching drivers (from which all others derive).   It is the sum, first, of the change in EVA Margin -- which reflects improvements or deteriorations in the 
total productivity of the business model spanning price power, operations efficiency and asset management --  and second, of "profitable growth", which is the product of the firm's sales growth rate 
and its EVA Margin. For instance, a company that increases its EVA Margin from 4.5% to 5%, coupled with 10% sales growth, produces 1% EVA Momentum -- half from the Margin improvement, and 
the other half from earning a 5% Margin on the 10% sales growth.  
One implication: firms with low and stagnant EVA Margins are incapable of generating EVA Momentum -- no matter how rapidly their book income, EBITDA or EPS expand. Firms with low or negative 
EVA Margins must first increase it before they have any chance to add value as they grow sales or expand their book earnings. 
Another implication: a profitable firm may forfeit some of its EVA Margin (and ROC), and yet still generate Momentum by achieving with sales growth at the Margin.  Google did that in 2007, a year it 
racked up nearly 8% in EVA Momentum.  Its EVA Margin shrank from 20% to 18%, but was more than compensated by 55% sales growth at the EVA Margin.  
EVA Momentum is thus a worthy successor to the DuPont ROI formula because, like ROI, it traces to operational ratios that characterize income efficiency and asset management, but better than ROI, it 
correctly incorporates the value of profitable growth and strategic retrenchment.  
Another advantage is that it is possible to figure out the projected EVA Momentum rate that is baked into stock prices.  That is possible because the present value of EVA is by definition the same as the 
net present value of discounted cash flow, and so the EVA trajectory that will discount back to the MVA reflected in the firm's share price can be determined.  
Once again, it is not possible to derive a market-implied ROI or EPS growth, because neither ROI or EPS discount to share value -- whereas EVA does (see MVA discussion).

Valuation Metrics
Market Value Added (MVA). The spread between a company’s overall market value, given its share price,  and the capital invested its business to produce the value. It is the difference between the 
sum of cash that investors have put into or left in the business as its capital and the present value of the cash they could expect to take out of it, if only by selling their shares. As such, it represents how 
much wealth the firm has created. It is also implicitly the aggregation of the net present values ("NPV's") of all existing and planned capital investment projects. Moreover, the period-to-period change 
in MVA, when coupled with the EVA profit actually earned, determines the rate of return the firm generates for its investors on the market value of their investment in the firm. 
In principle, a firm is fairly valued when its MVA is priced to equal the expected sum of the EVA profit it is able to earn in the future, after discounting to a present value. Businesses that are only 
capable of covering  their cost of capital and that break even on EVA break even on MVA, too.  They tend to trade close to the book value of their capital (actually, usually a bit more, as there is always 
the chance for a turnaround or takeover).  On the other hand, businesses like Apple's that handily return more than their cost of capital and which earn significant EVA profits trade for lofty MVA 
values.  They are bid to market value premiums over invested capital, which enhances the wealth of the investors, and in the process, generates outsized returns.  And the larger the EVA they earn and 
the more rapidly and surely they can expand it, the larger the MVA premium that  is warranted.  It works in reverse, too.  Negative EVA businesses, like GM in the 20 years leading up to the bankruptcy, 
are bid down to market valuations that discount, sometimes quite severely, the book value of their capital, leading to a loss of shareholder wealth.  
The rule above is theory and not always perfectly realized in practice across a market universe of 9000 stocks, which is the reason that the PRVit stock rating model is often capable of identifying mis-
valued stocks by weighing on the one side of the scale a set of EVA performance and risk factors that proxy for the present value of EVA, and on the other side, a variety of MVA related multiples 
derived from the firm’s actual market valuation.  The relative balance of intrinsic EVA value versus actual MVA valuation, compared to all other Russell firms, gives rise to the PRVit rating, and to insights 
about relative over-or under-valuations of individual companies.  
MVA Spread. The ratio of MVA/Capital, which indicates the rate at which a firm is creating wealth per unit of capital employed. Either a high ROC or significant stream of new positive EVA projects are 
needed to justify a high MVA index. 
Wealth Margin. MVA/Sales, which indicates the rate at which a firm is creating wealth per unit of sales. Either a high EVA Margin or a significant and long-lasting EVA Momentum trend are necessary to 
justify a high MVA margin.  To be precise, a firm’s MVA Margin should equal the capitalized value of its current EVA Margin plus the present value sum of the EVA Momentum it will accumulate over a 
growth horizon of 3-15 years. 
Future Growth Value (FGV). The portion of the firm’s MVA that exceeds the capitalized value of its current EVA. It is therefore the value that investors are currently paying in anticipation of growth in 
EVA. To take an example, suppose a firm's MVA is $1 billion, and that its EVA is currently running at $60 million. Suppose also that its overall cost of capital is 10%.  The capitalized value of its current 
EVA is $600 million ($60 million/10%), which leaves a $400 million residual as the future growth be negative, which occurs when a firm's EVA profit is at a cyclical peak, when patents are slated to 
expire or substitute products are coming on the market, or where contingent liabilities loom large.. value -- the premium the market is pre-paying for the value of anticipated growth in EVA (i.e., for 
continued EVA Momentum). Future growth value can also be negative, which occurs when a firm's EVA profit is at a cyclical peak, when patents are slated to expire or substitute products are coming 
on the market, or where contingent liabilities loom large.
Future Growth Reliance (FGR). Future Growth Value/Market Value.  It is the percent of the firm’s overall market value that is dependent on, actually, at the risk of, continued growth in EVA.  Stocks with 
high FGRs percentages qualify as PRVit "Buys" only if they are demonstrating a strong and reliable trend of improving EVA. 
Future Growth Margin (FGM). Future Growth Value/Sales (for the most recent trailing four quarters).  In principle, a fairly valued firm’s FGM should equal the present value sum of the EVA Momentum 
it will accumulate over a growth horizon of 3 -15 years.  Either a high EVA Margin or a significant and long-lasting EVA Momentum trend are necessary to justify a high FVA margin. 
Enterprise Multiple (EM). Enterprise Value/EBITDAR (which is EBITDA, plus rent, plus R&D and advertising, plus a handful of other corrective accounting adjustments).  EM is the number of years of pre-
tax operating cash flow required to match the firm’s Enterprise Value (which is just a slight variation on the aggregate market value of the firm’s debt and equity, and which includes the present value of 
rents to neutralize the comparison among firms that own or lease assets in differing proportions).  The higher the multiple, the more the firm must be able to reinvest its EBITDAR in EVA-enhancing 
investments and strategies. 
NOPAT Multiple. Market Value/NOPAT.  The number of years the firm must generate net operating profit after taxes at the current level to cover the current market value.  Unlike EBITDAR, NOPAT is 
net of depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of R&D and ad spending that under EVA is written off over time.  It is also net of tax.  Unsurprisingly, the NOPAT multiple tests better as 
a predictor of shareholder returns than the EBITDAR multiple (which in turn, tests better than the plain vanilla EBITDA multiple). In practice, using both together as a composite indication of the un-
leveraged valuation multiples the market is currently attaching to a company is even better -- as they are not perfectly correlated "signals".  In any case, the higher the multiples, the greater is the risk-
adjusted EVA performance in order for a stock to qualify as a PRVit "Buy". 
Risk Metrics
Stock Price Volatility. The standard deviation in monthly returns.  The higher it is, less confidence  can be attached to extrapolating past performance trends. 
EVA Margin Variability. The standard deviation in the firm's EVA Margin over the past three years.  The higher it is, more uncertainty is attached to extrapolating past performance trends. 
Financial Leverage. A heavy reliance on debt financing is a risk factor, making the firm vulnerable to sudden downturns, robbing it of flexibility to pounce on fleeting opportunities, and increasing the 
variability of the residual profit stream that accrues to the shareholders.  Debt reliance is indicated by the overall ratio of the firm’s total debt, including the present value of operating rents, to its total 
capital, and also by payback horizon, which is the number of years of pre-tax operating cash flow (EBITDAR) required to fully retire the debt obligations. 
Free Cash Flow (FCF). Cash operating receipts minus cash operating disbursements.  It can also be computed as NOPAT less the change in capital over the period.  A firm that earns more NOPAT than it 
re-invests has positive “free” cash flow, and thus the liquidity to distribute the surplus to investors or retain it as a cash reserve.  A firm that invests more than it earns, and which records a negative FCF, 
must raise debt or equity, or draw down on its excess cash balances. 
Free Cash Generation (FCG). The ratio of  FCF/Capital, the net cash flow yield on capital, a ratio that is mathematically the same as the firm’s ROC less the growth rate in its capital.  Positive cash 
generation is considered a sign of liquidity and staying power, and hence, lower risk.  Negative free cash generation is interpreted as a higher risk proposition.  For one, it prolongs the duration of the 
cash payback, making it riskier to project and value.  For another, it may be the result of aggressive and unproven acquisition spending.   Regardless, negative FCF generation requires external financing, 
and that puts the firm’s growth at the mercy of market access.  Being reliant on external financing sources also can lure management into adopting liberal accounting policies that make profit look 
better than it really is, raising questions about the quality of the earnings and corporate governance. 
Operating Cash Generation (OCG). OCG is operating cash flow after investment in working capital.  It is measured as cash operating profit after taxes (i.e., NOPAT plus depreciation and amortization) 
less the period investment in working capital.  OCG automatically converts all sales to cash sales (because it nets out uncollected receivables), deducts inventory accumulations and "channel stuffing", 
and voids non-cash provisions to reserves, such as bad debt, obsolescence, and short-term warranty and deferred revenue (regardless of whether the reserve accruals have been booked through 
NOPAT or left to stew in a contra working capital account).  Unlike the accounting-based “funds flow from operations", OCG is before interest expense, and thus it avoids the distortions of changes in 
debt/equity financing mix.  It is in principle an even better indicator of the cash generated from operations. 
OCG Return. OCG/Gross Long-Term Capital.   Gross long term capital is capital plus accumulated depreciation and amortization, less working capital.  It is the permanent, long term, capital invested in 
fixed plant, property and equipment, in long-term investments, and in intangibles, including goodwill, and other long term assets, and thus it is the capital base that corresponds to OCG.  The OCG 
Return thus indicates the operating cash flow yield on permanent capital.  A high OCG Return is a surer indication that business operations are actually generating liquidity, and that the firm's 
operations are inherently less risky than ones with low net cash returns. 
Payback Horizon. The ratio of the firm’s total debt/EBITDAR (which is EBITDA plus rent  plus research and ad spending, plus other corrective accounting adjustments).  It is the number of years of pre-
tax operating cash flow that is required to pay off the firm’s debt, including its operating lease commitments and on-balance sheet pension fund deficit.  A high ratio raises questions about a firm’s 
creditworthiness and its ability to pounce on fleeting opportunities and to withstand downturns and is taken as a sign of "vulnerability". 
Capital Ratio FEA (Financial Institutions only). The percent of financial earning assets, including the loan loss reserve, that is financed with capital (the remainder is funded with purchased funds -- 
deposits, borrowings, insurance reserves, etc.).  A higher ratio indicates more capital is being used to cushion business risk, and that risk insurance is effectively being purchased on the balance sheet.
