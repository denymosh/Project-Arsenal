Tesla: SpaceX and xAI Will Merge, but We Don't Rule Out 
Eventual Consolidation With Tesla 
Analyst Note Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 3 Feb 2026
SpaceX announced it acquired xAI, allowing the two companies to move forward as one to develop 
space-based data centers. Tesla shares were down 2% on Feb. 2 on the news.
Why it matters: The merger between SpaceX and xAI likely rules out Tesla acquiring SpaceX in the 
near future. Last week, Bloomberg reported SpaceX had been evaluating a deal with Tesla in addition to 
xAI. Instead, we expect SpaceX will proceed with an upcoming initial public offering later this year.
gTesla CEO Elon Musk remains the largest shareholder of SpaceX. So, we don't rule out Tesla 
eventually acquiring SpaceX. Rather, we think SpaceX going public may lead to less regulatory 
scrutiny if Tesla were to acquire SpaceX in the future as shareholders of both companies could vote 
on the deal.
gFurther, Musk has said in the past he sees Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI's businesses converging in the 
future, so we think a future deal could still occur. Tesla vehicles are currently using xAI's Grok large 
language model, and we see additional opportunities for Tesla and SpaceX to work together.
The bottom line: We maintain our $400 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. We had not 
previously assumed a deal with SpaceX would occur, so our outlook doesn’t change on this news.
gAt current prices, we view Tesla shares as fairly valued, with the stock trading a little above our fair 
value estimate and in 3-star territory.

gWe see no change to our outlook. The company is in the early stages of a transition from selling autos 
as its primary business to real world artificial intelligence, including autonomous driving software 
and humanoid robots.
Business Strategy & Outlook Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
Tesla is one of the largest battery electric vehicle automakers in the world. In less than a decade, the 
firm went from a startup to a globally recognized luxury automaker with its Model S and Model X 
vehicles. Tesla competes in the entry-level luxury car and midsize crossover sport utility vehicle markets 
with its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. It also sells a light truck—the Cybertruck—and a semi truck. 
Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi and a luxury sports car in the future.
Tesla aims to transition from primarily being an automaker to focusing on real world artificial 
intelligence. This includes self-driving software for use in its own vehicles and a ride-hailing service 
named robotaxi. The company is also working on developing humanoid robots for commercial and 
eventually consumer use. 
To build its products, Tesla often goes upstream and controls much of its supply process. This includes 
lithium refining, battery design and manufacturing, and semiconductor design.
Tesla is attempting to take a larger share of its customers' auto-related spending, which includes 
selling autonomous driving software on a subscription basis, insurance in a growing number of US 
states, and charging, where the company owns and operates over 8,000 fast charging stations globally. 
For robotaxi, we expect autonomous vehicles, namely Tesla's robotaxi and Alphabet's Waymo, to make 
up 50% of ride-hailing rides in the US and Canada by 2030, as robotaxis are cheaper than human 
drivers. Tesla is currently in the testing phase of its robotaxi service and currently tests in Austin, Texas, 
and the Bay Area of California, with plans to expand to at least seven more cities in 2026. The company 
is moving through testing and plans to remove safety drivers in its robotaxis in the Austin area in the 
near future. Over time, we think Tesla will grow to become one of the largest ride-hailing providers in 
North America.
Tesla also sells solar panels and batteries to consumers and utilities. As the battery-based energy 
storage market expands, Tesla is well-positioned to grow accordingly.
Bulls Say Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
u Tesla has the potential to disrupt multiple industries with its technology for EVs, AVs, batteries, and 
humanoid robots.
u Tesla's full self-driving software should generate growing profits in the coming years as the technology 
continues to improve, leading to a robotaxi service, increased adoption by Tesla drivers.

u Tesla's humanoid robot will create shareholder value as its ability to perform multiple functions will 
transform manufacturing and be useful to consumers.
Bears Say Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
u Traditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily in EV development, which will result in 
Tesla seeing a deceleration in sales growth and being forced to cut prices due to increased competition, 
eroding profit margins.
u Tesla's large investment into autonomous driving software will be value destructive as the robotaxi 
product will face delays and competition from Waymo, who already offers a robotaxi service.
u Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political activities will turn consumers away from buying a Tesla in key markets 
including the US and Europe, leading to lower sales and profits.

We award Tesla a narrow moat rating. Tesla's moat stems from two of our five moat sources: intangible 
assets and cost advantage. The company's strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands 
premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise allows the company to make its vehicles 
cheaper than its competitors.
Intangible Assets
Tesla's brand cachet is not likely to be impaired anytime soon as other automakers move into the 
battery electric vehicle space because we expect the company to keep innovating to stay ahead of 
startup and established competitors. The Model S Plaid, the most upgraded version of Tesla's luxury 
sedan, offers 390 miles of range, at the high end for electric vehicles. It does 0-60 mph in under 2 
seconds and has 1,020 horsepower, putting the Model S Plaid in a rare class of performance among all 
autos, regardless of powertrain. By focusing on the luxury auto market first, Tesla was able to create 
tremendous media publicity for the company that reaches beyond its customers. This generated strong 
consumer demand for its subsequent vehicles at lower price points, such as the Model 3 and Model Y. 
As other new vehicles are launched, such as the affordable SUV, we expect the company's strong brand 
will continue to generate consumer demand.
Tesla has a more high-tech vehicle with the ability to do drivetrain updates and other updates via Wi-Fi 
or a cellular connection, and customers do not have to visit a store for many service needs. Tesla will 
instead pick up the vehicle from home and often return it the same day, while providing a fully loaded 
loaner for no charge, or visit the customer's home or work and service the car there. This experience is 
much easier than many other automakers' service, which helps Tesla's brand equity. Further, this has 
been accomplished with little to no spending on advertising, which is rare for a consumer brand. This 
strong brand equity has carried over to Tesla's energy generation and storage business, where the 
company can charge a premium for its fully integrated solar panel, inverter, and home battery storage 
systems sold to consumers.
Tesla's proprietary technology contributes to its intangible asset-driven competitive advantage. This 
form of intangible assets applies to EVs due to their innovative, highly engineered nature and because 
patents for EV technologies hold somewhat less value due to the ability of competitors to create 
alternatively designed, but ultimately similar, products. Since launching the Model S in 2012, Tesla has 
been the industry leader in electric vehicles, producing the best EVs on the market. The company 
invests nearly 6% of sales in R&D to maintain its best-in-class range, which is well ahead of the 
competition on a miles per kilowatt-hour basis and continues to improve other vehicle specs such as 
power. Tesla is also investing heavily in its proprietary autonomous vehicle technology and building one 
of the world's largest supercomputers to train self-driving artificial intelligence. With R&D spending in 
line with its peers, we think Tesla will be able to maintain its proprietary technological advantage.

Tesla will face increasing competition in the coming years. Automakers plan to electrify their fleets by 
adding EV versions of existing vehicles and creating new platforms. However, we see EVs becoming a 
greater proportion of auto sales, growing to 30% by 2030 from 3% in 2020, which will expand the market 
as EVs rapidly take share from internal combustion engine vehicles. As new models are introduced, 
Tesla's technological advantage and the strength of its brand will remain intact, which will allow the 
company to continue to charge a premium price for its EVs.
Cost Advantage
We think Tesla benefits from a cost advantage in electric vehicles production thanks to its 
manufacturing scale. Tesla's total vehicle volume has grown from just over 100,000 in 2017 to nearly 1.8 
million deliveries in 2024. During the same period, the company's average cost of goods sold per vehicle 
has fallen over 55%, from $84,000 to just over $35,000. While some of this is due to manufacturing a 
greater proportion of midsize cars and SUVs versus luxury autos, the majority of the COGS decline has 
come from the company's focus on reducing manufacturing costs due to scale. Legacy automakers are 
gradually transitioning to BEV production from internal combustion engines, but we expect they will be 
saddled with legacy ICE costs for a long time. Even as legacy automakers begin to produce more EVs, 
we expect Tesla will continue to have lower costs as it has outlined a plan to further reduce unit 
production costs over the next several years with a new manufacturing process. With Tesla's cost per 
vehicle set to fall, legacy automakers may take years to catch up to Tesla, if ever, as they won't want to 
build many new factories from scratch like Tesla is doing.
We think Tesla's combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist in the future and 
allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital. We see the potential for Tesla to outearn its cost of 
capital over at least the next 20 years, which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating. 
However, the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader 
automotive industry, given the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies that could 
transform how consumers use vehicles. As such, we view a narrow moat rating, which assumes a 10-
year excess return duration, as more appropriate.
Fair Value and Profit Drivers Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
We raise our Tesia fair value estimate to $400 from $300 following the company's fourth-quarter 
earnings. The primary drivers are a higher robotaxi valuation, increased long-term adoption of Tesla's 
autonomous driving software, and a higher valuation of the humanoid robot business. We use a 
weighted average cost of capital of just under 9%. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse debt.
In 2026, we forecast deliveries will fall to 1.56 million versus the 1.64 million deliveries in 2025, largely 
due to the US EV tax credit expiration in September of 2025 and increased competition in Europe, where 
Tesla is currently unable to sell its autonomous driving software. As Tesla is ramping up production of

its new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, we expect automotive gross margins excluding 
credits will remain in the mid-teens, below management's long-term goal of 20%.
In the longer term, we assume Tesla will deliver around 2.8 million vehicles per year in 2030, driven by 
the adoption of full self-driving software and the more affordable versions of the Model Y and Model 3.
We forecast that the vast majority of deliveries will come from the Model Y and Model 3 platforms. Tesla 
plans to discontinue to Model S and Model X and we see Cybertruck, Roadster, and semitruck 
combining for roughly 30,000 deliveries per year.
We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per-vehicle 
basis. Including rising adoption of FSD subscription software, we forecast the segment gross margin 
will recover to the mid-20% range by the end of the decade, above the 18% generated in 2024 but below 
the 29% achieved in 2022.
We expect Tesla's robotaxi business will continue to progress through testing and enter multiple new 
cities in 2026, similar to how Waymo, Uber, and Lyft increased their service locations. Tesla will initially 
take an asset-heavy approach, owning its own vehicles and running the software. Eventually, Tesla will 
allow Tesla owners to add their vehicles to its robotaxi fleet. The majority of our valuation comes from 
Tesla's AI software and robotics ventures. Our robotaxi valuation accounts for around $120 per share, or 
roughly 30% of our Tesla valuation. Our FSD software subscription valuation accounts for $70 per share. 
However, this excludes the effect of higher deliveries and expanded automotive gross profit margins 
from increased production. Our base case also adds the present value of Optimus humanoid robot sales 
and subscription software, which we value at roughly $80 per share.
We also assume the successful growth of the insurance business and increased profits from the 
charging business result in long-term profit growth and margin expansion in the services and other 
segment.
In energy generation and storage, we assume the business averages annual revenue growth at nearly a 
30% range during our 10-year forecast, primarily driven by accelerating demand for energy storage 
systems. While we forecast ESS prices to decline, the fall will largely be driven by cheaper battery costs, 
which should not affect profitability. As volume grows, unit costs should fall. Combined with recurring 
revenue from long-term power purchase agreements and AI trading software, we expect the business 
will turn profitable and generate gross margins in line with peers such as Enphase and SolarEdge.
We assume overhead expenses continue to decline as a percentage of sales as the company benefits 
from operating leverage as deliveries grow. As a result, we forecast companywide operating margin will 
return to the midteens by the end of the decade, in line with the 17% achieved in 2022 and well above 
the 8% generated in 2024.

To fund this growth, we assume Tesla will spend nearly $170 billion in capital expenditures over the 
next decade. 
Given the wide range of outcomes, we also model upside and downside scenarios. 
Our upside scenario fair value estimate is $700. In this scenario, we assume Tesla increased market 
share gains for Tesla's real world artificial intelligence subscription software products. We value 
robotaxi at around $180 per share, Optimus at $300 per share, and FSD software subscriptions at 
around $80 per share.
Our downside scenario fair value estimate is $100 per share. In a downside scenario, assume Tesla is 
unsuccessful in its goal to transition to a real world artificial intelligence provider. We value the 
autonomous driving software business at just $10 per share and see slower growth in the insurance 
business. We assign no value to the company's robotaxi or humanoid robots ventures.
Risk and Uncertainty Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we see a wide range of potential 
outcomes for the company.
The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic 
conditions. As an EV market leader, Tesla is subject to growing competition. As new lower-priced EVs 
enter the market, Tesla has cut prices and offered lower-cost versions of its Model 3 and Model Y 
vehicles. Further price cuts could reduce profits. 
The company is also investing heavily in R&D and capital expenditures to develop autonomous driving 
software, robotaxis, and humanoid robots with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. As of the 
last SEC filing, Tesla's CEO owns roughly 12% of the company's stock and uses it as collateral for 
personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt.
Tesla also faces political risk related to the political activities of CEO Elon Musk. Musk served as an 
advisor to US President Donald Trump but has since made statements against Trump's policies. Musk 
also campaigned for the far-right Alternative for Germany party. These activities risk turning away some 
consumers from buying a Tesla.
Tesla faces ESG risks. As an automaker, Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in 
recalls, including its autonomous driving software. We see a moderate impact should this occur. 
Another risk involves employee retention. If Tesla is unable to retain key employees, such as CEO Elon 
Musk, its image as an innovative company could decline. We see a low probability but moderate 
materiality.
Additional ESG risks include potential patent litigation as the company relies on new technology to

improve its EVs and energy storage systems. We see a low probability but moderate materiality should 
this occur. Tesla may also face regulatory issues in some US states due to laws that require automakers 
and dealers to be separate. We see a moderate probability but low materiality.
Capital Allocation Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 29 Jan 2026
We award Tesla an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating based on our framework that assesses its 
balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.
We rate the balance sheet as sound. Tesla's revenue is subject to high cyclicality. However, with a 
healthy balance sheet and cash far exceeding total debt, Tesla should be able to easily meet its 
financial obligations.
We view management's investments as exceptional. To increase vehicles, the company built new 
factories around the world, including in China, the EU, and US. Given strong consumer demand, we 
think the capacity expansion plans make sense. We are in favor of the focus on reducing costs, as this 
should enable Tesla to keep its cost advantage intact as large legacy automakers electrify further this 
decade. Reduced manufacturing costs should enable Tesla to increase profit margins for its existing 
vehicles and produce an affordable sedan and SUV in the future at a profitable level. 
We also think management is smart to focus on its autonomous driving software going forward as we 
think this will be a product differentiator. We also like the move to sell insurance as this creates another 
recurring revenue stream. While Tesla is developing autonomous driving software for its vehicles, it 
also makes sense for the company to enter the ride-hailing industry with its robotaxis. Additionally, we 
like the goal for management to develop humanoid robots as these can reduce Tesla's manufacturing 
costs in its plants and add an additional recurring revenue stream in the future.
Finally, we are also in favor of the move to open Tesla's charging network to non-Tesla vehicles as it can 
drive additional revenue and profits from charging stations by increasing the capacity utilization of 
each station.
We see shareholder distributions as appropriate. Tesla does not pay a dividend and to date has not 
repurchased shares. Instead, it has used the capital markets to issue stock, most recently at value-
accretive levels. Given that Tesla is investing heavily in expanding its vehicle and battery production 
capacity, we think the best use of capital is internal reinvestment to fund organic growth rather than 
shareholder distribution. However, with solid free cash flow generation and little debt, management 
said it may consider share repurchases in the future. Tesla is currently preparing to ramp up production 
of its dedicated robotaxi vehicles and semi trucks. If its ride-hailing proves successful and autonomous 
driving software leads more consumers to buy a Tesla, the company may need to build more factories. 
So, we think Tesla holding cash for now makes sense as it may be needed to fund future growth, which 
we view as the best use of capital. Over time, we think share repurchases, at least to offset dilution from 
stock-based compensation, would make sense with excess cash flow once its new ventures, such as

robotaxi, begin generating positive free cash flow.
Elon Musk has been Tesla's CEO since 2008. Before co-founding Tesla, he co-founded and sold the 
internet payment system PayPal. Musk also co-founded SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Co. Further, 
Musk purchased Twitter, now called X, in late 2022 and was CEO until mid-2023. For Tesla, Musk's 
compensation comes entirely from stock awards. Under the plan created in 2018, Musk earned 304 
million stock option awards (split-adjusted, at a price of $23.34 per share) in 12 tranches based on 
meeting revenue, EBITDA, and market capitalization targets, which was completed by the end of 2022. 
Under Musk's new pay package, he will be able to earn more up to 423.7 million stock option awards 
over 12 tranches based on operational, EBITDA, and market capitalization targets. Tesla For future 
compensation awards, we would prefer a return on invested capital metric be added.

Tesla Earnings: Progress on Robotaxi and Optimus Shows Real World AI Growth; FVE to $400 From 
$300 Seth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,29 Jan 2026
The highlights of Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report were management's plans to expand its 
autonomous driving ride-hailing to more US cities and begin mass-producing its humanoid robots by 
the end of 2026. Tesla shares were up in after-hours trading as the market reacted favorably to the 
news. Why it matters: Tesla has been testing its robotaxi autonomous driving ride-hailing service in 
Austin, Texas, and the Bay Area of California. Tesla plans to expand to seven more US cities in the first 
half of 2026 and started removing its employees from its robotaxis in Austin. This shows the 
autonomous driving software is progressing well through testing. Improving software should also 
support Tesla's auto sales and its autonomous driving subscription software for Tesla owners. The plan 
to begin mass manufacturing the Optimus humanoid robot this year surprised us, as we thought the 
project was still several years away. To do this, Tesla will stop selling its Model S and X vehicles and 
retool the factory that produces them to enable robot production. The bottom line: We raise our fair 
value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla to $400 from $300. The primary drivers are a higher robotaxi 
valuation, increased adoption of Tesla's autonomous driving subscription software at a higher price, 
and a higher valuation of the humanoid robot business. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as fairly 
valued, trading around 10% above our fair value estimate, placing it in 3-star territory. The bulk of our 
valuation comes from the long-term free cash flow generation of Tesla's subscription software from its 
autos, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. While Tesla continues to test its software, we expect the stock to 
remain volatile as it progresses with these new products.

vehicles and robotaxis as a part of its CES 2026 presentation. In response to Nvidia's announcement, 
Tesla's shares were down 5% at the time of writing on Jan. 6. Why it matters: Tesla, along with 
Alphabet's Waymo, is the current leader in autonomous driving software, including robotaxis. Nvidia's 
system would likely be sold to multiple automakers, allowing them to quickly close the gap in personal 
vehicles and, over the long term, in robotaxis. Increased competition in autonomous driving software for 
both personal vehicles and robotaxis could weigh on Tesla's growth. We think the market is reacting to 
a lower growth outlook for Tesla following Nvidia's entrance into autonomous driving systems. The 
bottom line: We are maintaining our $300 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. At current prices, 
we view Tesla shares as overvalued, trading nearly 45% above our fair value estimate and in 2-star 
territory. Our forecast assumes Tesla sees increased adoption among Tesla owners for its autonomous 
driving software and successfully launches its robotaxi service. However, we assume a roughly 30% 
ride-hailing market share for Tesla by 2035, with competitors increasing their market share as well. 
Nvidia's announcement included a broader entrance into real-world artificial intelligence, where Nvidia 
aims to develop the software to run robots in manufacturing plants. This would likely compete directly 
with Tesla's humanoid robots should both company's systems become commercial. 
Tesla: Shares Fall on Fourth-Quarter Deliveries Decline Seth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,2 
Jan 2026
Tesla reported 418,227 deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 1,636,129 for the year. The company 
also reported 46.7 gigawatt hours of battery storage deployment. Tesla shares were down around 2% at 
the time of writing Jan. 2. Why it matters: Fourth-quarter and full-year deliveries were down 16% and 
9%, respectively. Tesla was affected by the expiration of the US electric vehicle tax credit that expired in 
September. We expect deliveries will continue to fall through the first three quarters of 2026. In Europe, 
deliveries declined due to increased competition. In 2026, deliveries will depend on Tesla's ability to sell 
its autonomous driving software, which is currently awaiting regulatory approval. Should Tesla receive 
approval, we expect deliveries to rise. Otherwise, we see another decline. We think much of Tesla's 
valuation remains driven by market sentiment around the robotaxi business, where the company 
continues to progress through testing, including testing its Cybercab vehicle. We think the robotaxi will 
continue to be the primary driver of the stock in 2026. The bottom line: We maintain our $300 fair value 
estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. The 2025 deliveries were just below our estimate, but we had expected 
a decline. We view Tesla shares as overvalued with the stock trading a little less than 50% above our fair 
value estimate and in 2-star territory. We forecast the robotaxi will remain in testing throughout 2026. 
We see expanded testing, which includes additional cities, the removal of the Tesla employee who is a 
safety monitor in the vehicle, and Cybercab testing. Yet, we continue to expect full launch to not occur 
until 2027-28.

Equity Analyst,22 Dec 2025
On Dec. 19, after the market close, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that 
had voided Tesla CEO Elon Musk's 2018 pay package. Tesla shares were up 2% in early Dec. 22 
trading.Why it matters: Most Tesla shareholders voted for the pay package twice, once in 2018 and 
again last year. So while the compensation is not in line with traditional executive pay, the shareholders 
are in favor of it. The pay package, which is entirely share-based compensation, is also key to keeping 
Musk as Tesla's CEO. Musk has said he would like a greater ownership percentage of Tesla over time, so 
this and the new 2025 pay package could allow him achieve this goal.The bottom line: We maintain our 
$300 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued, 
trading in 2-star territory and more than 60% above our fair value estimate. Following the 2025 pay 
package, we see little key-person risk that Musk would leave Tesla. We expect Musk will remain as a key 
executive over at least the next decade, as this is the duration over which Musk has to meet the targets 
in the new pay package. 
Tesla: We See Little Effect From California Ruling to Suspend Production and Sales for 30 Days Seth 
Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,17 Dec 2025
A California administrative law judge ruled that Tesla will face a 30-day suspension of its licenses to 
produce and sell vehicles within the state. Tesla shares were down slightly on Dec. 17 at the time of 
writing. Why it matters: The California plant is Tela's second-largest in the US, and the firm sells more 
vehicles in that state than in any other. A suspension of its production and sales would have a 
significant near-term financial impact on the company. The suspension ruling was due to Tesla's 
marketing around its Autopilot and full self-driving software. The California Department of Motor 
Vehicles said it would pause enforcement of the order for 60 days to allow the company time to address 
its marketing claims. Tesla noted the case was not due to any customer complaints and expects sales in 
California to continue uninterrupted. We think Tesla will change its marketing messaging enough to 
avoid the suspension of both its production and sales licenses in California. As a result, we expect no 
impact on the company from the ruling. The bottom line: We maintain our $300 fair value estimate for 
narrow-moat Tesla. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued, with the stock trading more 
than 60% above our fair value estimate and in 2-star territory. Even without a suspension, we forecast 
Tesla will see declining US deliveries in the fourth quarter and early 2026. This is due to the expiration 
of the US electric vehicle tax credit, which expired Sept. 30. We expect this will weigh on 2025 sales and 
cause 2026 deliveries to decline. Yet, Tesla's stock reflects market optimism for its autonomous driving 
software that will power its robotaxi ride-hailing service and its full self-driving subscription software. 
While we think Tesla will successfully develop the software, we think the market is assigning it too high 
a valuation.

Analyst,15 Dec 2025
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company is testing its ride-hailing robotaxis in the Austin, Texas, area 
without safety monitors in the vehicles. Tesla shares reacted positively to the news with the stock up 4% 
on Dec. 15 at the time of writing. Why it matters: Tesla is in the early testing of its robotaxi product in 
select US cities. In its current form, Tesla has an employee, referred to as a safety monitor, in the vehicle 
during a ride. Removing the safety monitor is a signal the software is improving and testing is 
progressing. The progress is also in line with management's guidance during its third-quarter earnings 
call that Tesla would be able to remove the safety monitors in the next several months. The bottom line: 
For now, we maintain our $300 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. We maintain our outlook for a 
2028 full robotaxi launch throughout the US, which includes no safety monitors, limited to no 
geofencing, and dedicated robotaxi vehicles. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued with 
the stock trading around 60% above our fair value estimate and in 2-star territory. We think the market 
is assigning too high of a valuation to Tesla's robotaxi business. We forecast Tesla will successfully 
launch its robotaxi product and grow to a 30% market share of ride-hailing rides in the US and Canada 
over the next decade. Yet, as autonomous rides drive prices down, we see smaller profits and free cash 
flows versus the market implied valuation. K

Research Methodology for Valuing Companies
Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projec-
tion of a company’s future cash flows, resulting from our 
analysts’ research. Analysts create custom industry and 
company assumptions to feed income statement, balance 
sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our glob-
ally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or 
DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical tools to augment this process. Moreover, we 
think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows 
presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies, 
high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g., 
mines), or companies expected to generate negative 
earnings over the next few years. That said, we don’t dis-
miss multiples altogether but rather use them as sup-
porting cross-checks for our DCF-based fair value estim-
ates. We also acknowledge that DCF models offer their 
own challenges (including a potential proliferation of es-
timated inputs and the possibility that the method may 
miss shortterm market-price movements), but we believe 
these negatives are mitigated by deep analysis and our 
longterm approach.
Morningstar’s equity research group (”we,” “our”) be-
lieves that a company’s intrinsic worth results from the 
future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premi-
um to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in 
Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the 
biggest risk adjusted discount to their fair values, where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic 
worth.
Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) 
our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our es-
timate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around 
that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. 
This process ultimately culminates in our singlepoint star 
rating.
1. Economic Moat
The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not 
only in our qualitative assessment of a firm’s long-term 
investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of 
our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural 
feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a 
long period of time. We define economic profits as re-
turns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our es-
timate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost 
of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more 
susceptible to competition. We have identified five 
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are 
more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns 
for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are 
those in which we have very high confidence that excess 
returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more 
likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer 
a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic 
value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will 
see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.
When considering a company's moat, we also assess 
whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, 
stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, 
financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this con-
text, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if 
its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit 
on a cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the prob-
ability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not char-
acterize the company as possessing an economic moat.
2. Estimated Fair Value
Combining our analysts’ financial forecasts with the 
firm’s economic moat helps us assess how long returns 
on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm’s cost of 
capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rat-
ing are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a 
longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat 
firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:
Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts 
make full financial statement forecasts, including items 
such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in 
workingcapital accounts, and capital spending. Based on 
these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, 
after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.
Stage II: Fade
The second stage of our model is the period it will take 
the company’s return on new invested capital—the return 
on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to de-
cline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II 
period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in 
lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance 
sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The 
length of the second stage depends on the strength of the 
company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last 
anywhere from one year (for companies with no econom-
ic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat compan-
ies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four 
assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period, a normalized investment rate, average return on 
new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years 
until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The invest-
ment rate and return on new invested capital decline un-
til a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms 
that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal 
ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attribut-
able to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the 
second stage.
Stage III: Perpetuity
Once a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate a continuing value, using a standard per-
petuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any 
growth or decline or investment in the business neither 
creates nor destroys value and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.
Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash 
flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present 
value of expected future cash flows. Because we are 
modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash 
available to provide a return to all capital providers—we 
discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a 
weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and pre-
ferred stock (and any other funding sources), using ex-
pected future proportionate long-term, market-value 
weights.
3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate
Morningstar’s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture 
the range of potential outcomes for a company’s intrinsic 
value. This rating is used to assign the margin of safety 
required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives 
our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating is 
aimed at identifying the confidence we should have in as-
signing a fair value estimate for a given stock. 
Our Uncertainty Rating is meant to take into account any-
thing that can increase the potential dispersion of future

outcomes for the intrinsic value of a company, and any-
thing that can affect our ability to accurately predict 
these outcomes. The rating begins with a suggested rat-
ing produced by a quantitative process based on the 
trailing 12-month standard deviation of daily stock re-
turns. An analyst overlay is then applied, with analysts 
using the suggested rating, historical rating data, and 
their own knowledge of the company to inform them as 
they make the final Uncertainty Rating decision. Ulti-
mately, the rating decision rests with the analyst. Ana-
lysts take into account many characteristics when mak-
ing their final decision, including cyclical factors, opera-
tional and financial factors such as leverage, company-
specific events, ESG risks, and anything else that might 
increase the potential dispersion of future outcomes and 
our ability to estimate those outcomes. 
Our recommended margin of safety—the discount to fair 
value demanded before we’d recommend buying or 
selling the stock—widens as our uncertainty of the estim-
ated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain we 
are about the potential dispersion of outcomes, the great-
er the discount we require relative to our estimate of the 
value of the firm before we would recommend the pur-
chase of the shares. In addition, the Uncertainty Rating 
provides guidance in portfolio construction based on risk 
tolerance. 
Our Uncertainty Ratings are: Low, Medium, High, Very 
High, and Extreme.

Our uncertainty rating is based on the interquartile 
range, or the middle 50% of potential outcomes, covering 
the 25th percentile–75th percentile. This means that 
when a stock hits 5 stars, we expect there is a 75% 
chance that the intrinsic value of that stock lies above the 
current market price. Similarly, when a stock hits 1 star, 
we expect there is a 75% chance that the intrinsic value 
of that stock lies below the current market price.
4. Market Price
The market prices used in this analysis and noted in the 
report come from exchange on which the stock is listed 
which we believe is a reliable source.

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we 
compare it with the stock’s current market price on a 
daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calcu-
lated at the market close on every day the market on 
which the stock is listed is open. Our analysts keep close 
tabs on the companies they follow, and, based on thor-
ough and ongoing analysis, raise or lower their fair value 
estimates as warranted.
Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars. 
That is, the percentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can 
fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can 
serve as a gauge of the broader market’s valuation. When 
there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole 
is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few 
companies garner our highest rating.
We expect that if our base-case assumptions are true the 
market price will converge on our fair value estimate over 
time generally within three years (although it is im-
possible to predict the exact time frame in which market 
prices may adjust).
Our star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and 
individuals must consider their own specific investment 
goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income 
needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other 
factors.
The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined be-
low:
QQQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk ad-
justed return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. 
Scenario analysis developed by our analysts indicates 
that the current market price represents an excessively 
pessimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximiz-
ing upside potential.
QQQQ We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-ad-
justed return is likely.
QQQ Indicates our belief that investors are likely to re-
ceive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of 
equity).
QQ We believe investors are likely to receive a less than 
fair risk-adjusted return.
Q Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjus-
ted returns from the current market price over a multi-
year time frame, based on our analysis. Scenario analysis 
by our analysts indicates that the market is pricing in an 
excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential 
and leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

and shareholder distributions. Analysts consider com-
panies’ investment strategy and valuation, balance sheet 
management, and dividend and share buyback policies. 
Corporate governance factors are only considered if they 
are likely to materially impact shareholder value, though 
either the balance sheet, investment, or shareholder dis-
tributions. Analysts assign one of three ratings: "Exem-
plary", "Standard", or "Poor". Analysts judge Capital Alloc-
ation from an equity holder’s perspective. Ratings are de-
termined on a forward looking and absolute basis. The 
Standard rating is most common as most managers will 
exhibit neither exceptionally strong nor poor capital al-
location.
Capital Allocation (or Stewardship) analysis published 
prior to Dec. 9, 2020, was determined using a different 
process. Beyond investment strategy, financial leverage, 
and dividend and share buyback policies, analysts also 
considered execution, compensation, related party trans-
actions, and accounting practices in the rating.

Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating Assessment:The ESG 
Risk Rating Assessment is provided by Sustainalytics; a 
Morningstar company.
Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Ratings measure the degree to 
which company’s economic value at risk is driven by en-
vironment, social and governance (ESG) factors.
Sustainalytics analyzes over 1,300 data points to assess a 
company’s exposure to and management of ESG risks. In 
other words, ESG Risk Ratings measures a company’s un-
managed ESG Risks represented as a quantitative score. 
Unmanaged Risk is measured on an open-ended scale 
starting at zero (no risk) with lower scores representing 
less unmanaged risk and, for 95% of cases, the unman-
aged ESG Risk score is below 50.
Based on their quantitative scores, companies are 
grouped into one of five Risk Categories (negligible, low, 
medium, high, severe). These risk categories are absolute, 
meaning that a ‘high risk’ assessment reflects a compar-
able degree of unmanaged ESG risk across all subindus-
tries covered.
The ESG Risk Rating Assessment is a visual representa-
tion of Sustainalytics ESG Risk Categories on a 1 to 5 
scale. Companies with Negligible Risk = 5 Globes, Low 
Risk = 4, Medium Risk = 3 Globes, High Risk = 2 Globes, 
Severe Risk = 1 Globe. For more information, please visit 
sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings/
Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluat-
ing a company or security. Ratings involve unknown risks 
and uncertainties which may cause our expectations not 
to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected 
and should not be considered an offer or solicitation to 
buy or sell a security.
Risk Warning
Please note that investments in securities are subject to 
market and other risks and there is no assurance or guar-
antee that the intended investment objectives will be 
achieved. Past performance of a security may or may not 
be sustained in future and is no indication of future per-
formance. A security investment return and an investor’s 
principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an 
investor’s shares may be worth more or less than their 
original cost. A security’s current investment perform-
ance may be lower or higher than the investment per-
formance noted within the report. Morningstar’s Uncer-
tainty Rating serves as a useful data point with respect to 
sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in our de-
termining a fair value price.
