Argus Analyst Report
Meta Platforms operates the world's largest family of social networking websites, including the
flagship Facebook site, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads. The sites
enable users to communicate with friends and family by posting content; to comment on the posts
of others; to share photographs, website links, and videos; to message; and to play games. The
company also partners with application developers to add functionality to the sites and allows
users to pay for virtual goods and services through its Payments function. Meta's
Superintelligence Labs is one of the pioneers in generative AI research and its Reality Labs
segment develops and sells new computing form factors like virtual reality headsets and smart
glasses.
Analyst's Notes
Analysis by Joseph Bonner, CFA, January 30, 2026
ARGUS RATING:  BUY
• Monetization and engagement demonstrate operational success
• The company reported that GAAP EPS rose 11% on 24% revenue growth in 4Q25, this as Meta
accelerated revenue growth, though costs and GenAI investments also ramped higher.
• Meta is benefiting from solid advertising revenue, though investments in GenAI compute
infrastructure are indeed spiking even higher in 2026.
• Meta is looking to GenAI to underpin several opportunities, from enhanced targeted advertising
to its Ray-Ban AI glasses.
• We are lowering our 2026 GAAP EPS estimate to $30.07 from $30.38 and establishing our
2027 forecast at $35.08.
INVESTMENT THESIS
    We are maintaining our BUY rating on Meta Platforms Inc. (NGS: META) and
our target price of $800. As is the case with most companies, Meta has a variety of
both opportunities and risks. Its user growth at scale is certainly striking, as both
monetization and engagement demonstrate its operational success. The company's
ability to capitalize on GenAI advances in advertising targeting is a particularly

INVESTMENT THESIS
relevant opportunity to drive advertising spending, which is the
company's lifeblood. On the risk side of the ledger, market
wariness of the ability of Meta to reap return on invested capital
from its GenAI investments has risen. Although the internal use
cases for its GenAI development are attractive, its market position
is such that it lacks the ability to market these developments to
third parties (as competitors OpenAI, Microsoft Corp., Alphabet
Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. do).
    Meta typically builds an audience for new products before
moving to monetization, and we think this is again CEO Mark
Zuckerberg's clearly stated strategy regarding generative AI
applications to Reality Labs hardware products. On the 4Q call,
Mr. Zuckerberg spoke coyly about new AI-powered product
developments, though we were tantalized by the prospect of new
releases in 2026. We also expect GenAI to continue to pervade
Meta's applications and provide another means of optimizing
company performance and efficiency. We also note that Reality
Labs losses continue to mount.
    We give management kudos for rapidly delivering Threads, a
Twitter/X competitor, as it looks to take share amid that
company's arguably self-inflicted wounds, and Reels, a TikTok
competitor. We caution investors that the regulatory threats
against Meta in the U.S. and Europe are a material risk. Though
the outcomes of the myriad regulatory and legal challenges to Meta
remain unclear, they already have led to large fines/settlements and
could eventually lead to more material fines and/or onerous
regulatory actions. Our short- and long-term ratings on META
remain BUY.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
    Meta posted 4Q and 2025 results after the close on January 28.
The company beat the consensus revenue estimate by $1.48 billion.
Revenue also beat the high end of management's guidance range by
$893 million. EPS beat consensus by $0.69. Meta continues to
grow rapidly at scale. On a user base of 3.54 billion, the company
added another 18 million users in 4Q25. Monetization was again
truly impressive, and one of our critical performance metrics,
family average revenue per person, rose 18% year over year. Meta
is also guiding to 30% revenue growth in 1Q26, its fastest growth
rate since 3Q21. META shares rose 10% on January 29.
    As with other Tech GenAI companies, Meta's capital
expenditure (capex) ramp has generated intense investor interest as
it chases the newest developments in GenAI. With 4Q results, Meta
announced another increase in its 2026 capex guidance to $115
billion-$135 billion. This guidance implies an incremental $52
billion increase in capex from 2025 at the midpoint, which, using a
consensus estimate for revenue, would bring capital intensity to
over 50%, probably the highest among the big three GenAI
competitors in our coverage: Meta, Alphabet/Google, and
Microsoft.
    Revenue rose 24% from the prior year to $59.9 billion.
Advertising revenues, the company's primary revenue stream, rose

Analyst's Notes   ...Continued
24% to $58.1 billion. Both total revenue and advertising revenue
accelerated significantly from 21% and 21%, respectively, in 4
Q24. We recognize the turnaround as noteworthy given Meta's
scale. The average price per ad increased 6%, while the more
important ad impressions metric increased 18%, triple the rate in 4
Q24. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand
due to improved ad performance. Impressions growth was
primarily driven by improved engagement and user growth.
Management focused on engagement improvements on the
quarterly call. Meta is seeing ranking and product improvements
driving incremental engagement, with Instagram Reels watch time
up more than 30% in 4Q year over year.
    Meta's reporting structure now separates its Family of Apps
(Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services)
from its Reality Labs (RL) segment, which is focused on the
GenAI/metaverse business. Family of Apps revenue rose 25% in 4
Q25, accelerating from 21% in 4Q24, and is generated by
advertising. RL revenue is an inconsequential 1% of revenue.
    Family of Apps operating income rose 9% to $30.8 billion in 4
Q, while the RL operating loss was $6 billion, in line with recent
quarters. The cumulative loss on RL is now $79 billion.
Management is guiding that RL's operating losses in 2026 will be
about at the same level as the $19 billion loss in 2025. These losses
are a tough load for Meta to carry, though part of the price of Mr.
Zuckerberg's strategic decision to pursue foundational generative
AI computing as the failed metaverse concept sinks further into the
dustbin of history. Fourth-quarter consolidated income from
operations increased 6% to $24.7 billion, while the operating
margin narrowed by 7 percentage points to 41%. Total expenses
accelerated 40.5% in 4Q25, driven by higher employee
compensation expense (all those reportedly extraordinary lucrative
AI talent-signing contracts), legal expenses, and compute
infrastructure costs. GAAP diluted EPS rose 11% to $8.88 from
$8.02 in 4Q24.
    For 2025, revenue rose 21% to $201 billion. EPS declined 2%
to $23.49 from $23.86 in 2024. Investors should remember that
Meta took a $6.20 per share noncash charge in 3Q25 related to a
tax valuation allowance. Adjusting for this charge, pro forma 2025
EPS would have risen 24%.
    On January 13, Mr. Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a
new initiative to drive the engineering, investments, and
partnerships for Meta to build 'tens of gigawatts' of power supply
'this decade.' This initiative is obviously targeted to Meta's
generative AI ambitions, which Mr. Zuckerberg sees as critical to
the company's future. As we have noted before, as investments in
GenAI infrastructure spike throughout the tech space, power may
just be the gating factor for GenAI compute expansion rather than
chips, other hardware, or real estate.
    On December 29, 2025, Meta announced its agreement to
acquire Manus, a Singaporean startup that developed 'autonomous

Argus Analyst Report
Analyst's Notes   ...Continued
general-purpose agents that can independently execute complex
tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.' However, in
early January, press reports indicated that the Chinese Ministry of
Commerce is investigating whether the deal violates Chinese
technology export controls. Provided the deal is actually approved,
we see Manus as creating an agentic layer on top of a GenAI large
language model (LLM), enabling real-world business applications.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the value of the deal is $2.5
billion, though the actual acquisition price remains publicly
undisclosed. Manus claimed annual recurring revenue (AAR) of
$100 million in December 2025, which would put the Meta deal's
valuation at 25-times ARR, which we see as a high valuation. Meta
expects both to continue to operate Manus as an independent
subsidiary and to incorporate its technology across Meta's product
line. While the Manus deal pales in comparison to Meta's $14
billion-plus deal to acquire just a 49% interest in Scale AI in June
2025, it is one more indication of the continued seriousness of the
company's strategic push to become competitive in GenAI. Meta
has been castigated as a perennial also-ran in GenAI and, starting
in 2025, has been attempting to buy its way into a more
competitive position.
    On January 22, Meta's archrival TikTok U.S. announced its new
incarnation as TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, bringing to a
close a multiyear, drawn-out controversy around a law banning
TikTok from the U.S. and efforts by the company and the current
federal administration to work out suitable arrangements with
Chinese authorities and TikTok parent ByteDance to keep TikTok
working in the U.S. while coming into compliance with the law.
The new deal allegedly separates TikTok U.S. from its Chinese
parent ByteDance, though ByteDance retains a 19.9% interest in
TikTok USDS. While other details of the TikTok deal are beyond
our scope here, our concern has to do with the competitive threat
to Meta's Instagram Reels service, which is essentially a TikTok
lookalike, providing users short-form, algorithmically based video
content. TikTok USDS now claims 200 million users, with 7.5
million businesses participating in the service in the U.S., and now
that it is free to operate as it chooses in the U.S., it could become
and even more potent Meta competitor.
EARNINGS & GROWTH ANALYSIS
    We are lowering our 2026 GAAP EPS estimate to $30.07 from
$30.38 and establishing our 2027 forecast at $35.08. We note the
large tax-valuation charge in 3Q25, which impacted our 2025
estimate. Our EPS estimates imply 22% growth over the next two
years. Management expects its operating costs to accelerate in
2026 due to a sharp increase in depreciation from infrastructure
costs and the growth in employee compensation from the spike in
new hires in 3Q25. This guidance led us to remain conservative on
2026. Our long-term earnings growth rate forecast is 16%.
    Meta has executed on GenAI improvements to ad-targeting
systems and moved into GenAI ad creation. Management directly
attributes its 4Q success to the improvement these innovations
have brought to user engagement and ad load optimization, the
underpinnings of revenue growth. Meta boasts that it can target
audiences with the right creative ad content better than the
advertisers themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg has laid out 'five major
opportunities' for Meta, including the aforementioned improved
advertising, as well as more engaging experiences, business
engagement, business messaging, the Meta AI application, and AI
devices. Mr. Zuckerberg expects GenAI advances to drive all of
these opportunities. Mr. Zuckerberg has made clear Meta's
commitment to building its own GenAI frontier models. One key
differentiator that we see as a uniquely valuable asset for Meta in
the GenAI race is the amount and specificity of user data the
company retains on more than 3 billion users. New GenAI-
powered features can mine all this user data for more powerful
contextual clues to enable better, more-personalized content
recommendations as well as content creation that drives
engagement. GenAI business agents are expected to power
customer support and sales on both the WhatsApp and Messenger
message applications. While the Meta AI application has 1 billion
monthly active users, it is still considered an also-ran in the GenAI
application race. Finally, AI devices are finding their initial form
factor in the company's Ray-Ban Mea AI Glasses, which have
tripled in sales over the last year, albeit from what we think is a
small base.
    User growth and monetization remain key performance
indicators for Meta. Family average revenue per person was up
18% from the prior year. The company's user base, called Family
Daily Active People, rose 6.2% year over year to 3.56 billion in 4
Q25. A Daily Active Person is defined as a registered and logged-in
user of one or more of the company's Family products (Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp) on a given day. Of course,
monetization is not just dependent on adding users but also on user
engagement.
    Management's original rationale for the breakout of its Reality
Labs segment was to provide investors with visibility into what it
views as the metaverse, its next-generation social media
communications platform. However, RL has been refocused on the
company's GenAI development with the establishment of Meta's
Superintelligence Lab in 2025. While superintelligence is a
somewhat fuzzy concept, Mr. Zuckerberg's vison is to build GenAI-
powered 'personal superintelligence' that empowers users to
achieve their goals and then deliver this superintelligence to Meta's
billions of users and business customers. The company's
introduction of smart Ray-Ban glasses in 2024 continues to be a hit
with prosumers, and Meta has now gone all in on the glasses' form
factor as the driver of its GenAI wearable products. Sales of its AI-
powered smart glasses tripled in 2025, and press reports indicate
that Meta may double production in 2026.
    While Meta is laser focused on developing its own frontier
GenAI models, it has also been signing massive AI infrastructure
compute deals with partners in order to feed the beast of its GenAI
research and development. In August 2025, Meta signed a reported
$10 billion, six-year deal with frenemy Google, another competitor
in the GenAI LLM development race, for GenAI compute services.
In September 2025, Meta signed a $14.2 billion, six-year GenAI
infrastructure deal with CoreWeave Inc., a cloud AI platform
company.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH & DIVIDEND
    We rate Meta's financial strength as High, the top rating on our
five-point scale. Total debt at the end of 2025 was $59 billion, all
of it long term. The company raised an incremental $30 billion in
debt in November 2025. Meta also had cash, equivalents, and
marketable securities of $81.6 billion at the end of 2Q25. While
Meta could currently pay off all its debt from its cash reserves,
CFO Susan Li noted on the 4Q25 call that Meta may 'eventually

FINANCIAL STRENGTH & DIVIDEND
maintain a positive net debt balance,' implying that its AI
investments may eventually require higher debt loads. Free cash
flow continued to fall off a cliff in 4Q25, as the company pursued
investing in its genitive AI priorities. It generated $43.6 billion in
trailing-12-month free cash in 2025, down 16% or $8.5 billion
from 2024.
    Meta's quarterly cash dividend is $0.525, or $2.10 on an annual
basis. The indicated yield is about 0.3%. Our 2026 dividend
estimate is $2.21, and we are establishing a 2027 forecast at $2.32.
    Meta repurchased $26.25 billion of its Class A stock in 2025,
after buying back $30.125 billion in 2024, $19.8 billion in 2023,
and $27.9 billion in 2022. The share count declined by 1%, or 34
million shares, in 2025.
MANAGEMENT & RISKS
    On November 18, 2025, a federal judge ruled that the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) had failed to prove its antitrust case
against Meta. The FTC alleged that Meta has maintained a
monopoly in the market for personal social networking through its
unlawful acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in
2014, though the acquisitions were approved by the FTC at those
times. The FTC had asked the court to break up Meta through the
divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta successfully made
the case that its market had changed dramatically over the years,
with the rise of alternative social media sites, particularly the viral
popularity of TikTok, and now the rising threat to Meta's business
from the advent of new generative AI models. The judge even
mentioned that TikTok currently 'holds center stage as Meta's
fiercest rival' in his Memorandum Opinion. While Meta had been
under the threat of possible breakup for the last five years, since
the filing of the original FTC case in December 2020, we had noted
some of the holes in the government's case. U.S antitrust enforcers
are now batting 0 for 2 after the judge in the Google antitrust case
ruled for the government but declined to impose any real penalties
on Alphabet/Google. The judge in the Meta case pointed to the
struggles of a glacially paced regulatory response to the rapidity of
innovation and competitive changes in the technology space that
makes it difficult to statically define a product market.
    While Meta came out on top in the recent FTC case, it remains
vulnerable to extreme regulatory backlash in the U.S. and globally,
related to antitrust; alleged harms to minors; the spread of
misinformation, including election interference; the spread of
unlawful content in private groups and encrypted communications;
the misuse of members' private information; and alleged bias,
among other issues.
    In another ongoing threat to Meta, the first in a series of trials
accusing Meta and other social networks of harming children and
adolescents began in Los Angeles on January 27, with more trials
to follow in 2026 and 2027. For several years, individuals and
state attorneys general have been suing Meta alleging that Meta
has harmed the psychological health of children and adolescents by
knowingly designing psychologically manipulative 'technologies to
entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens.' The suits
allege that Meta lied to the public by minimizing the damaging
impact of these technologies and violated the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act by unlawfully collecting 'the personal data
of its youngest users' without their parents' permission. The
lawsuits seek injunctions to stop the alleged actions, as well as
monetary damages for such alleged harms, and the tort litigation
bar has reportedly taken a keen interest, sniffing a big payday from
Meta's pot of gold. We think the scientific data may be arguable
either way, though the litigation discovery process could lead to
some embarrassment for Meta. Whether or not smart lawyers can
actually prove that a so-called 'defective' Meta product caused a
particular harm to a particular individual, the litigation, at a
minimum, provides another round of headline reputational risk for
Meta. We give our usual caveat that litigation is inherently risky
and even more so in the sense these cases often present individuals
against a large and already not well-liked corporation to a jury. In
its 2026 guidance, Meta referenced the litigation and upcoming
trials 'in the U.S., which may ultimately result in a material loss.'
    Meta is appealing a decision and a record 1.2 billion euro ($1.3
billion) fine levied by the European Data Protection Board in May
2023. The ongoing litigation has, at a minimum, increased
headline risk for Meta. Management distraction is another risk
arising from regulatory litigation and investigations, particularly in
the European Union (EU).
    In late 2022, the EU passed the Digital Services Act (DSA) and
the Digital Markets Act (DMA), both aimed at severely regulating
large online businesses, i.e., Meta and other large American tech
companies. The DSA and DMA are aimed at regulating practices
around content moderation/disinformation and user privacy,
among other issues, and Meta will be required to undergo outside
audits of its practices and share algorithmic data with EU
regulators.
    The European Commission (EC) found Meta in breach of the
DMA on April 22, 2025, and fined the company 200 million
euros, or about $224 million. While Meta noted in its 2026
guidance that it had 'recently aligned with' with the EC on making
changes to a 'Less Personalized Ads offering' in Europe, it
continues to monitor regulatory issues in the U.S. and Europe that
could significantly impact its business.
    Like all advertising-dependent companies, Meta could be hurt
severely by a decline in advertising. This risk is heightened by the
uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic growth, which closely
correlates with advertising growth. Meta may be more resilient
than other ad-reliant companies due to the secular trend of
advertisers moving to digital from other channels and to its
sophisticated ad audience targeting tools.
    While Meta's user growth has migrated toward developing
markets, the U.S. (Meta's home market) is still the most lucrative.
As such, a meaningful defection of U.S. users from the flagship
Facebook site (other than to Facebook's own sister applications
Instagram, WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads) could materially impact
the company's performance and business model. A significant loss
of advertisers would also be a material problem.
    Meta is almost entirely dependent on advertising revenue, which
has grown to about 98% of total revenue. The secular trend of
advertisers devoting more and more of their advertising dollars to
internet-based advertising generally has softened the effect of
cyclical swings in the online advertising market. The flagship
Facebook platform is at saturation in the U.S., meaning that
growth in that platform will likely slow over time. Meta's emerging
platforms, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads,
have been building their respective user bases nicely and are in
various stages of monetization. Management has also warned that

it is willing to sacrifice short-term margin expansion for long-term
user growth and increased engagement.
    Competition in the internet space is intense, and Meta is up
against a number of larger companies with greater resources,
including Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, and Apple Inc. The
company also competes with smaller virally popular and niche
social media companies like TikTok, X Corp., Snap Inc.'s
Snapchat, Reddit Inc., and Discord Inc. As Meta expands
internationally, it must manage its market expansion, where it may
have limited understanding of the local culture. It also faces
pressure from 'national champion' competitors, especially in
China, where it is currently banned. Government regulation and
the possible censorship of site content also could become much
more burdensome in the coming years, both in the U.S. and in
international markets. The Snowden revelations involving the use
of American internet company data by the National Security
Agency could make Meta's penetration of foreign markets much
more difficult and result in restrictions or outright bans by foreign
governments.
    On January 12, Meta announced the appointment of Dina
Powell McCormick to the new role of president and vice chairman.
Ms. Powell McCormick is a Washington D.C. insider and held
senior positions in the George W. Bush and first Trump
administrations. President Trump even made a laudatory post after
the appointment. Ms. Powell McCormick is also one-half of a D.C.
power couple with her husband, Pennsylvania Republican senator
Dave McCormick. Apart from simply currying favor with the
current administration, Ms. Powell McCormick's purview in the
new position will include 'helping guide the company's overall
strategy and execution.' In particular, she will work with Meta
Compute in building 'new strategic capital partnerships' globally.
With Meta ramping capex spend even higher in 2026, we see Ms.
Powell McCormick as a key hire. Ms. Powell McCormick is a
direct report to Mr. Zuckerberg.
    Meta made headlines in 3Q25 because of its recruitment of
many star GenAI researchers, with reports of $100 million offers
to staff its newly named Superintelligence Lab, now led by
renowned AI entrepreneur Alexandr Wang. In June 2025, Meta
invested a reported $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Mr. Wang's
GenAI startup Scale AI Inc., hiring away Mr. Wang and some of
his team. The impact of Meta's 2025 hiring spree drove operating
expenses higher, and 2026 guidance shows them going higher still.
COMPANY DESCRIPTION
    Meta Platforms operates the world's largest family of social
networking websites, including the flagship Facebook site,
Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.
The sites enable users to communicate with friends and family by
posting content; to comment on the posts of others; to share
photographs, website links, and videos; to message; and to play
games. The company also partners with application developers to
add functionality to the sites and allows users to pay for virtual
goods and services through its Payments function. Meta's
Superintelligence Labs is one of the pioneers in generative AI
research and its Reality Labs segment develops and sells new
computing form factors like virtual reality headsets and smart
glasses. Meta derives about 63% of its revenue from outside the
U.S.
VALUATION
    META shares were up about 6% in the last year on a total
return basis, compared to a 16% gain for the S&P 500, a 42%
gain for the S&P Interactive Media & Services Industry Index, a
15% gain for the NYSE Fang+ Index, and a 21% gain for the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, according to Bloomberg.
META shares have been hurt by market skepticism around the
return on investment on its huge and ramping AI investments. The
forward enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of 14.6 is 1%
below the peer average, compared to a two-year historical discount
of 8%. The lagging EV/EBITDA of 18.3 is above the peer median
of 17. We are maintaining our BUY rating on Meta and our target
price of $800.
    On January 30, BUY-rated META closed at $716.50, down
$21.81.

Argus Analyst Report
About Argus
    Argus Research, founded by Economist Harold Dorsey in 1934,
has built a top-down, fundamental system that is used by Argus
analysts. This six-point system includes Industry Analysis, Growth
Analysis, Financial Strength Analysis, Management Assessment,
Risk Analysis and Valuation Analysis.
    Utilizing forecasts from Argus’ Economist, the Industry Analysis
identifies industries expected to perform well over the next one-to-
two years.
    The Growth Analysis generates proprietary estimates for
companies under coverage.
    In the Financial Strength Analysis, analysts study ratios to
understand profitability, liquidity and capital structure.
    During the Management Assessment, analysts meet with and
familiarize themselves with the processes of corporate management
teams.
    Quantitative trends and qualitative threats are assessed under
the Risk Analysis.
    And finally, Argus’ Valuation Analysis model integrates a
historical ratio matrix, discounted cash flow modeling, and peer
comparison.
THE ARGUS RESEARCH RATING SYSTEM
    Argus uses three ratings for stocks: BUY, HOLD, and SELL.
Stocks are rated relative to a benchmark, the S&P 500.
• A BUY-rated stock is expected to outperform the S&P 500 on
a risk-adjusted basis over a 12-month period. To make this
determination, Argus Analysts set target prices, use beta as the
measure of risk, and compare expected risk-adjusted stock
returns to the S&P 500 forecasts set by the Argus Market
Strategist.
• A HOLD-rated stock is expected to perform in line with the
S&P 500.
• A SELL-rated stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500.
